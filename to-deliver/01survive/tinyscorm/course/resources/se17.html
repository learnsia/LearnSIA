For example, if users of systems on a particular network do not require direct access to external networks, and inbound connections are forbidden, then there is no reason to connect the network to external networks in the first place.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Prevention</strong></span></p><p>Prevention refers to the implementation of measures and controls to minimize the possibility of security problems occurring. For example, it may be necessary to store different kinds of data on a common file server. To prevent unauthorized access to each kind of data, access controls should allow users to see only those kinds of data they have permission to see.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Detection</strong></span></p><p>Despite all efforts to prevent unauthorized access to information assets and resources, security incidents are bound to occur. It is therefore necessary to implement measures to detect possible information security problems when they occur. For example, it may be appropriate for you to deploy network traffic monitors to alert you to unauthorized connection attempts to your networked systems.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Containment and response</strong></span></p><p>When information security incidents occur, you will have to work quickly to contain the damage and respond to prevent further unauthorized activity.  Preparation and practice in handling security incidents is an essential part of maintaining readiness to respond when incidents occur.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Recovery</strong></span></p><p>When system failures and security incidents occur, you will need to have resources and data backups available to restore your data, systems, networks, and security infrastructure to a "known-good" state.  This means that preparation and ongoing effort must be applied in advance to back up data and systems.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Improvement</strong></span></p><p>New threats to the security of information and information systems are discovered every day. Intruders actively seek ways to infiltrate systems in search of information and resources. As a result, it is necessary to engage in a continuous effort to sustain and improve the security of the networked information systems under your administrative control. As security incidents occur, lessons learned help to identify areas in need of improvement. Staying up to date regarding newly discovered problems and the means to mitigate them are essential elements of a continuous security improvement process.</p></div></body></html>
