</p><p>The following important summary points for "Principle1, Survivability is an enterprise-wide concern" provide relevance for future reference and assessment.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Survivability is an enterprise-wide concern.  Security is just a component of survivability.</p></li><li><p>Mission survivability is the key: it is linked to the survivability of its systems and components.</p></li><li><p>A survivability approach expands the view of security from a narrow technical specialty, accessible only to security experts, toward a risk-management perspective.</p></li><li><p>Unbounded systems are affected by the Internet (trends indicate increases in intrusions, vulnerabilities, number of hosts, and more sophisticated attacks). Enterprise network systems are "unbounded" (i.e., well-defined geographic, political, cultural, and legal or jurisdictional boundaries to systems characterized by the absence of these boundaries).</p></li><li><p>The focus of survivability is on unbounded networked systems where traditional security precautions are inadequate. These networked systems are interdependent instead of insular and fortress-like, with less distinction between system insiders and outsiders.</p></li><li><p>Survivability concentrates on recovery from a damaging effect, not the cause. The mere threat of an attack can have as severe an impact on a system as an actual occurrence.</p></li><li><p>Apply synergistic, layered solutions in an attempt to accomplish the mission and mitigate potential failures.</p></li><li><p>A fundamental assumption is that no system is totally immune to attacks, accidents, or failures. Anticipate failures and intrusions.</p></li><li><p>Firewalls, cryptography, access control, authentication, and other mechanisms used in computer security are meant to protect an underlying application in much the same way regardless of the specific application being protected. Ultimately, it is the mission that must survive and not any particular component of the system or even the system itself.</p></li><li><p>Essential services are defined as the functions of the system that must be maintained when the environment is hostile, or when failures or accidents occur that threaten the system. </p></li><li><p>Central to the delivery of essential services is the capability of a system to maintain essential properties (i.e., specified levels of integrity, confidentiality, performance, and other quality attributes). If an essential service is lost, it can be replaced by another service that supports the mission fulfillment in a different but equivalent way that need not be simultaneously available.</p></li><li><p>Survivable systems must exhibit the following key properties: resistance to attacks, recognition of attacks, recovery of essential services after an attack, and adaptation to reduce the effectiveness of future attacks.</p></li><li><p>Information assets (information, hardware, software, people) and other supporting assets must be evaluated and prioritized to determine if they are critical assets, which have an integral relationship with the mission of the organization.</p></li><li><p>For risk to exist there must be threats and vulnerabilities to critical assets. Risk can be managed but not eliminated.</p></li><li><p>Intruders can be difficult to identify, as they have various means, motives and opportunities at their disposal.</p></li></ol></div><p>These are important summary points from the discussion of Principle 1: Survivability is an enterprise-wide concern. Students should be able to enumerate or substantiate these points for future reference and assessment.</p></div></body></html>
