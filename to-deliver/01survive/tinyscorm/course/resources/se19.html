</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Example: Survivability of an enterprise's critical Web service</strong></span></p><p>Imagine you are responsible for the computer system services of a fictional e-commerce company called XYZprice.com. In addition to selling products from its own catalog, XYZprice provides the ability for a customer to directly browse a catalog from an affiliated supplier, and to have those items added to your XYZprice shopping cart. The sequence of events that occurs in a transaction is as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Through the XYZprice Web page, a customer indicates that they want to directly look at affiliated suppliers. catalogs and possibly purchase some items that may not currently appear on the XYZprice product database. A message is sent from the Web Browser the XYZprice Web Server over the Internet.</p></li><li><p>The XYZprice Web Server assembles a list of affiliated suppliers that support selecting products from their catalog and having them added to the customer's XYZprice shopping cart. An updated Web page is sent from the XYZprice Web Server to the customer's Web Browser over the Internet.</p></li><li><p>The customer selects a specific supplier's catalog. Information is sent from the customer's Web Browser to a particular supplier's Web Server over the Internet, creating a session that allows the customer to view and add products from the supplier's catalog to a local shopping cart. When finished, the customer clicks on the Checkout button on the Web page.</p></li><li><p>The supplier's Web Server sends a message over the Internet to the customer's Web Browser, returning the list of items selected to the customer.</p></li><li><p>The customer elects to checkout and purchases the selected items. A message is sent from the customer's Web Browser over the Internet to the XYZprice Web Server, providing the list of purchased items. The XYZprice Web Server assembles the data for the customer transaction and forwards it to the XYZprice Transaction Web Server over the Internet.</p></li><li><p>The XYZprice Transaction Web Server processes and approves the request, and then generates and forwards a purchase order for products to the supplier's Web Server over the Internet.</p></li></ol></div><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"></colgroup><thead><tr><th><p><span class="bold"><strong>Test your understanding:</strong></span></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">
