It is intended to permeate all levels of an organization, from the leadership that sets corporate direction, through middle management that approves requests for capital and time needed for other levels to achieve survivability, to programming that practices survivability, and systems administration that recommends and installs technology in support of survivability. It is important to know about survivability and how to engineer it into existing and new functional units.</p><p>Survivability is much more real-time oriented than, for example, disaster recovery, in which a functional unit's constituency knows about disasters and what to expect when they occur. In contrast, intrusions and outages related to failures are typically unexpected. Organizations that do not anticipate them and plan accordingly can be adversely affected by their constituency's reactions to such an outage.</p></div></body></html>
