As a consequence, many of the assumptions underlying traditional security technologies are no longer valid. Failure to recognize the depth and breadth of these changes prevents effective solutions to modern security problems.</p><p>Examining survivability allows us to look at security with a new technical and business perspective, which is essential to our search for solutions. Moreover, a survivability approach expands the view of security from a narrow technical specialty practiced by experts to a risk-management issue requiring the participation of an entire organization (executive management, security experts, application domain experts, and other stakeholders) to protect mission-critical systems from cyber attacks, failures, and accidents.</p><p>Survivability requires a systematic approach to assure that systems operating in an unbounded network are robust in the presence of attacks and able to survive intrusions.  This approach is described further in <span class="emphasis"><em>Survivability: Protecting Your Critical Systems [Ellison 99]</em></span>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The term "system" is used in the broadest possible sense, to include networks and large-scale systems of systems. In particular, the focus of survivability is on unbounded networked systems where traditional security precautions are inadequate. The term "mission" refers to a set of very high-level (i.e., abstract) requirements or goals. Judgments as to whether or not a mission has been fulfilled are typically made in the context of external conditions that may affect the achievement of the mission's goals. Timeliness is a critical factor that is typically included in (or implied by) the very high-level requirements that define a mission. However, timeliness is such an important factor that it is included explicitly in the definition of survivability.</p></blockquote></div><div class="informaltable"><table border="0"><colgroup><col width="50%"><col width="50%"></colgroup><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><td class="auto-generated">&nbsp;</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Our survivability approach concentrates on the effect of a potentially damaging event. Typically, for a system to survive, it must react to (and recover from) a damaging effect (e.g., the integrity of a database is compromised) long before the underlying cause is identified. In fact, the reaction and recovery must be successful whether or not the cause is ever determined."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Survivability concentrates on recovery from a damaging effort, not the cause.
