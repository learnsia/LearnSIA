Thus, it is important to define minimum levels of quality attributes that must be associated with essential services.</p><p>The capability to deliver essential services (and maintain the associated essential properties) must be sustained even if a significant portion of the system is incapacitated. Furthermore, this capability should not be dependent upon the survival of a specific information resource, computation, or communication link. A survivable financial system is one that maintains the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of essential information and financial services, even if particular nodes or communication links are incapacitated because of an intrusion or accident, and that recovers compromised information and services in a timely manner. The financial system's survivability might be judged by using a composite measure of the disruption of the stock trades or bank transactions (i.e., a measure of the disruption of essential services).</p><p>Ultimately, mission fulfillment must survive, not any portion or component of the system. In some cases if an essential service is lost, it can be replaced by another service that supports the mission fulfillment in a different but equivalent way. As a result, we define essential services to include alternate sets of essential services (perhaps mutually exclusive) that need not be simultaneously available. For example, a set of essential services to support power delivery may include both the distribution of electricity and the operation of a natural gas pipeline."</p></blockquote></div><p>To maintain an enterprise's capabilities to deliver essential services, their survivable systems must exhibit the following four key properties indicated in Survivability: Protecting Your Critical Systems <span class="emphasis"><em>[Ellison 99]</em></span>:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Resistance to attacks (i.e., strategies for repelling attacks)</p></li><li><p>Recognition of attacks and the extent of their damage (i.e., strategies for detecting attacks and intrusions, understanding the current state of the system, evaluating the extent of the damage)</p></li><li><p>Recovery of full and essential services after attack (i.e., strategies for restoring compromised information or functionality, limiting the extent of the damage, restoring essential services with the time constraints of the mission)</p></li><li><p>Adaptation and evolution to reduce the effectiveness of future attacks (i.e., strategies for improving system survivability based on knowledge gained from intrusions)</p></li></ul></div><div class="table"><a name="d0e859"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Review</b></p><table summary="Review" border="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"></colgroup><thead><tr><th><p>Test Your Understanding:</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>
