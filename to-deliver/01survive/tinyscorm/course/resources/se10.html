Before you can apply appropriate survivability measures to an asset, you must evaluate its importance to the mission of the organization, and then identify risks associated with that asset.  After the risks have been articulated, risk management decisions are made and appropriate survivability measures (safeguards) may be set in place.</p><p>In this analogy, the base gymnasium is of less importance to the overall mission of the military organization on the base.  Because of this, relatively few survivability measures have been applied to mitigate the risk of intrusion.</p><p>In contrast, the headquarters is considered to be the most vital building on the military base.  It is central to all operations in both peacetime and war.  Because the risks associated with it are much higher and more varied, many layers of survivability measures have been applied to it.  Additionally, because the complexity of these measures is far greater than the complexity of the measures for the gym, the overall investment for the headquarters is greater.</p><p>An organization's public Web server will likely be more important to its mission than an individual employee's desktop workstation.  As a result, greater efforts will likely be made to ensure the survivability of the Web server's mission.</p></div></body></html>
