</p><p>Many enterprises have contingency plans for dealing with business interruptions caused by natural disasters or accidents. Although the majority of cyber attacks are relatively minor in nature, a cyber attack on an organization's critical networked information systems has the potential to cause severe and prolonged business disruption, whether the business has been targeted specifically or is a random victim of a broad-based attack.  If a cyber attack disrupts critical business functions and interrupts the essential services that customers depend upon, then the survival of the enterprise itself is at risk. <span class="bold"><strong>(Principle 3: Not all data is of equal value to the enterprise - risk must be managed)</strong></span>

</p><p>An example would be the Web services offered by major banks. If a bank's home page were to be defaced as part of a cyber attack, it would very likely decrease the confidence that patrons have in the bank's ability to safeguard their money.  These patrons may decide to move their money elsewhere. Therefore, relatively benign attacks (from an operational stand-point) can cause significant damage to the overall business survivability of an organization.</p><p>One significant difference between disruptions caused by natural disasters and those caused by cyber attacks (besides the notion of an intelligent adversary behind a cyber attack) is that with a natural disaster there is a customer expectation of diminished service. A business disruption caused by a cyber attack will likely be seen by an enterprise's customers as a sign of incompetence.  Unless the cyber attack is widespread and well publicized, no customer sympathy will be forthcoming [Lipson 99].</p><p>It is essential that survivability be treated holistically when managing IT systems and information assets.  Sustaining the mission of the organization is, after all, the primary motivation for investing in survivability components in the first place - not just protecting systems from intruders.</p></div></body></html>
