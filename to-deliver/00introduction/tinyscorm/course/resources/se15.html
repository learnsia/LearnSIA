</p><p>Information assurance can be understood as the information operations (IO) that protect and defend information and information systems (IS) by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. This includes providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.</p><p>SA activities should be governed by organizational policies, including security policies. Such policies define acceptable and unacceptable behavior for all users including system administrators. The presence of a policy can protect an administrator; the absence can be harmful. Administrators need to understand the importance of documenting, implementing, and enforcing policies that are regularly reviewed and updated and reflect their roles.</p><p>This SIA curriculum principle looks at key principles and characteristics of an effective policy, identifies key stakeholders who need to be involved in the policy process, describes what an administrator needs to know, and includes a number of policy examples to consider.</p></div></body></html>
