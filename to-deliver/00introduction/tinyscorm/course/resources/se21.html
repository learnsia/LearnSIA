</p><p>Communication is another fundamental principle reinforced throughout the SIA curriculum. The key points of communication are the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>To be most effective, communication must be in the language of the listener. For example, when an SA speaks to upper management, the language they use should be less technical and more business-oriented than that used when two SAs interact. The SA must realize that to be effective, they need to get their technical message across in a way that can be understood clearly, evaluated properly, and responded to correctly. To gain a manager's trust, confidence, and understanding, the SA needs to demonstrate that they care about the business as much as they want the manager to care about security.</p></li><li><p>The SA must also learn some of the ways of business and be prepared to translate business terms into the appropriate actions at a technical level. The risk evaluation module helps them to be better equipped to deal with the realities of business and their part in supporting the mission of an organization.</p></li><li><p>All employees in an organization should recognize that information survivability is a fundamental principal and that achieving and sustaining survivability requires a collaborative effort. This means that the SA is prepared to talk with many in the organization to achieve information survivability. Communication skills are a key element of this challenge.</p></li></ol></div><p>Communication skills and the ability to speak in the language of the listener move the SA beyond the traditional role of being a skilled technology-only contributor and into the realm of being a significant contributor to the success of achieving the enterprise's mission.</p></div></body></html>
