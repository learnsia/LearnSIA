</p><p>It can be an overwhelming task to wade through the wide range of public domain, commercial, and custom security products and tools. The roadmap is intended to show that there are various levels of technology sophistication and complexity that can be applied to address security and survivability issues. As an example, the list below shows some of the technologies that can be applied to improve the security of user authentication security. The list starts with the weakest practice and builds to stronger and more complicated practices.</p><p>No authentication: If the computer system user can physically access the console, then this is presumed to be sufficient for them to have access to the resources available through that computer system.</p><p>Login and reusable password: The user uses the standard login and password pair to authenticate to a computer system. This is the most common practice in use today.</p><p>Login and one-time password: The user uses a login as before but uses additional information in the form of a one-time password or some other type of challenge/response scheme (SNK-4 or equivalent technology).</p><p>Biometrics: The user is identified to a computer system using some form of biometric device, such as a fingerprint or retinal scanner.</p><p>Biometric plus one-time password: This is referred to as three factor authentication (something you know, something you have, and something you are). It is the strongest form of user authentication available using today's technology.</p><p>The purpose of the roadmap is to show the SA where the state of the practice of technology is and what the areas for growth look like. Using the previous example, item number 2 (login and reusable password) is the current state of the practice, but the SA ought to know what other options are and how they may compare. This critical thinking about technologies is an important skill for the SA to master because they will often be expected to evaluate emerging technologies by comparing them with presently deployed technologies.</p></div></body></html>
