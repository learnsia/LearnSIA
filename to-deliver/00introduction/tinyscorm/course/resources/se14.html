</p><p>In every organization, there are many instances of information assets or data, but not all instances are of equal value. By understanding the relative importance of each information asset to the organization's mission, the SA can direct the survivability efforts towards protecting assets based on their criticality and priority. The SIA curriculum uses information security risk evaluation to identify the most important information assets. It uses the OCTAVE&reg;  [Alberts 01a] risk evaluation method to assess the risks to information assets using a scenario built for this part of the curriculum.</p><p>System administrators need to know about risk management because the SA cannot protect all assets. Security procedures and technologies are risk mitigation techniques that need to be selected and managed to minimize risks to critical information assets. The SA needs to understand risk management concepts and practices from this perspective, as well as the grand plan and their part in it so that they can effectively execute their responsibilities. This SIA curriculum principle explains what risk evaluation is and the role played by system administrators.</p></div></body></html>
