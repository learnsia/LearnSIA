Today's professional system administrators are increasingly challenged to make computer and network security a greater part of their already overflowing set of daily activities. Current workload demands can result in insufficient attention being paid to security issues and concerns, a situation that usually continues until their organization is the victim of an intrusion. After such an event, security receives an inordinate and undeserved level of attention that slowly declines over time to a level higher than previously, but still less than required. These peaks and valleys continue with each new security event until an organization integrates security into standard business processes.
</p><p>System administrators can be more effective in securing computer systems and network infrastructure components if they are properly educated and trained. They need a way to think about security issues and a set of skills to help them integrate security policy, practices, and technologies into their operational infrastructure, thereby fulfilling their job responsibilities.</p><p>The SIA Curriculum is designed to teach system administrators about security, as well as, a means for integrating security into their routine tasks. The intent is to avoid most of the aforementioned peaks and valleys, producing a more secure operational state. This means that the appropriate security practices, procedures, and skills should be implemented sooner rather than later, and in a more predictable fashion.</p><p>To achieve these goals of thinking about security issues in a more deliberate way and gaining skills, the curriculum teaches how to sustain, improve, and build Survivable Functional Units (SFUs).  It also provides a means to practice and demonstrate these skills, and the critical thinking process involved. Survivable Functional Units are described in detail later.</p><p>The target audience for this curriculum is a person who is seeking, or already has, a job as a system or network administrator (or related job title) requiring a background in protecting the critical information assets on computers and distributed systems and networks.</p><p>Those enrolled in this curriculum should have a minimum of two years of experience as a system administrator. They should have experience in installing and maintaining computer systems and networking infrastructure components and managing user accounts and files.</p><p>Administrators who provide management oversight of a system administrative function and a technical orientation can also benefit from this course, even if they lack the necessary technical knowledge or interest in the remaining courses of the SIA curriculum.</p><p>This curriculum teaches a new method for performing traditional systems administration tasks, and it integrates the concepts of survivability and security into those tasks. The curriculum consists of the following major topic areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Principles of Survivability and Information Assurance</p></li><li><p>Information Assurance Networking Fundamentals</p></li><li><p>Sustaining, Improving, and Building Survivable Functional Units (SFUs)</p></li></ul></div><p>There is a companion lab designed to prepare students to better understand the Guided Tours and Demonstrations and to do the Exercises that are part of the "Information Assurance Networking Fundamentals" and "Sustaining, Improving, and Building Survivable Functional Units (SFUs)" courses in the SIA Curriculum. For the student proficient with the technology of the institution, this companion lab serves as a refresher or baseline for current skills.</p><p>This course is also intended for the immediate managers of the system administrators taking this course. It is important for those managers to understand the SIA principles so they can better understand and manage the system administrators working for them.</p><p>The concepts and philosophies described in the SIA Curriculum are old in some ways and new in others. For example, many traditional tasks that system administrators have done for many years now have names and an ordering as prescribed by the Security Knowledge in Practice (SKiP) method of system administration. Overt recognition and use of policies, procedures, and risk management concepts and techniques by system administrators as well as a direct connection between computer systems and network infrastructure components and the mission of the enterprise are examples of new thinking for the SA.</p><p>System administrators who change their thinking from the traditional-where system administrators were kings and queens who made computer systems and network infrastructure components "dance" to their own songs-to the modern-where system administrators make computer systems and network infrastructure components dance to the organization's tune and survive in today's world-will be the most successful and will be in high demand. The principles described in this course and repeatedly applied throughout the SIA Curriculum are what system administrators need to achieve that level of success. Their knowledge of these principles and their ability to apply them in an enterprise sets them apart from their technologically proficient and business un-savvy counterparts.</p></div></body></html>
