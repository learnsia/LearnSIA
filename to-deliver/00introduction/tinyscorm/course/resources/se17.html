</p><p>Survivable functional units are a collection of computer systems and network infrastructure components that deliver information assets through one or more services to various constituencies that are authenticated to the survivable functional unit. The SFU should be constructed to provide essential services in the presence of attacks and failures, and recover full services in a timely manner.</p><p>This principle elaborates on the idea that every computer system and network infrastructure component is part of a Survivable Functional Unit (SFU), and that every Functional Unit should have an architecture that describes what it looks like, accompanied by a set of questions the SA should consider when sustaining and improving existing functional units and building new ones.</p><p>The process of sustaining, improving, and building SFUs is a major objective of the SIA curriculum. Since this is a relatively new way of looking at Information Assurance, it is important to understand what an SFU is and why they are the cornerstone of a survivable network system.</p><p>A typical enterprise (business, university, or even a home network) consists of a collection of computer systems and network infrastructure components intended to help the enterprise achieve its mission. In most cases, these computer systems are connected by a network infrastructure made up of routers, firewalls, hubs, switches, wires, wireless access points, and network interface cards (NICs). The method of interconnecting an organization's computer systems and the selection of network infrastructure components can vary widely from enterprise to enterprise. Presently, there are few best practices that guide system administrators through the task of architecting and building these networks.</p><p>Each computer system and network infrastructure component in the enterprise's network has one or more roles that are achieved by providing a service to a constituency. For example, one system could provide time synchronization information to other systems in the enterprise's network. </p><p>Consider an arbitrary enterprise's network. It should be possible to group the computer systems and network infrastructure components in this network into higher-level, function-oriented entities called Functional Units. A Functional Unit (FU) is a set of one or more computer systems and network infrastructure components that provide a service to a constituency.</p><p>In the best case, each computer system or network infrastructure component should be a member of only one Functional Unit. Pragmatically, this is often not the case, primarily for economic reasons. There is usually some overlap when a system provides more than one service and therefore, is a member of more than one Functional Unit. Routers and firewalls are typically members of more than one Functional Unit.</p><p>This higher level, service-oriented Functional Unit perspective is useful when thinking about infrastructure. Administrators should be able to identify all Functional Units in their enterprise and the information processes that form each Functional Unit. Similarly, for each information process, the administrator should know to which Functional Unit it belongs. </p><p>For example, an enterprise that provides Web services to the Internet likely has a Web Development and Delivery Functional Unit. This Functional Unit likely consists of at least the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>One or more computer systems that provide Web access to the Internet constituency. These are the delivery computer systems.</p></li><li><p>The networking components that connect these computer systems.</p></li><li><p>One or more computer systems used to create the content delivered by the delivery computer systems. These are called the development computer systems.</p></li><li><p>The networking components that connect these computer systems.</p></li><li><p>The networking components (routers, firewalls, etc.) that separate the delivery computer systems from the development computer systems.</p></li><li><p>The networking components that separate the delivery computer systems from the constituency, the Internet in this case.</p></li></ol></div><p>When taken together, these information processes make up the Web Development and Delivery Functional Unit that serves the Internet constituency. The Functional Unit is a complete entity and the best practices for sustaining, improving, and building it need to be applied to it as an entity.</p><p>For example, the best practices for the Web Development and Delivery Function Unit consist of but are not limited to the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The delivery computer systems do not contain the authoritative copy of Web site content. That content resides on the development computer systems.</p></li><li><p>The development and delivery computer systems are separated by a firewall that defines a strict policy that significantly reduces the traffic that can move between these systems.</p></li><li><p>The delivery computers are attached to a public network section that may have no other computer systems attached to it. These computer systems are "expendable systems" that are presumed to be frequently attacked and perhaps even compromised. This results in minimal damage due to the tight security and vigilance practiced by the system administrators.</p></li></ol></div><p>The individual computer systems and network infrastructure components that compose the Functional Unit must also be thought of as discrete components subject to the application of best practices. This means that the system(s) that delivers content to a constituency needs to reflect (for example) the best practices as outlined in Securing Network Servers [Allen 01] and Securing Public Web Servers [Kossakowski 01]. The firewalls that separate computer systems from one another should also follow the best practices outlined in Deploying Firewalls [Fithen 99].</p><p>The Web Delivery and Development Functional Unit information process architecture should reflect the best practices for such a Functional Unit. Unfortunately, these best practices are not yet formally defined. The architecture of a Functional Unit is often either created anew on an as-needed basis or informally shared between administrators. </p><p>Examples of other Functional Units are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Electronic Mail</p></li><li><p>Remote Access</p></li><li><p>Wireless Access</p></li><li><p>Domain Name Service</p></li><li><p>Intrusion Detection</p></li><li><p>Event Logging</p></li><li><p>File Backup and Recovery</p></li></ol></div><p>Functional Units need to provide service to a constituency in a survivable manner [CERT b]. Survivability is <span class="bold"><strong>"the ability of a network computing system to provide essential services in the presence of attacks and failures, and recover full services in a timely manner"</strong></span>. Architecting services to be survivable given increased dependence upon the Internet and increased attack sophistication is critical. Functional Units, therefore, must be survivable and survivability must become a design criteria.</p><p>Unfortunately, applying survivability in an operational setting is not yet well defined. There are few practices that can be used when architecting and building a Survivable Functional Unit. Nonetheless, some improvements to the Web Delivery and Development Functional Unit can make it more survivable. Those improvements may include the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>A distributed delivery architecture that makes use of several computer systems. These computer systems are connected to different networks and each is connected to the Internet through a different Internet Service Provider (ISP). This redundancy attempts to mitigate the risks of an attack on any one of the computer systems or ISPs.</p></li><li><p>The Domain Name Service Functional Unit balances the load from the constituency across all of these computer systems through round-robin or some other scheduling approach. This scheme attempts to make the number and placement of the delivery computer systems transparent to the constituency.</p></li><li><p>The computer systems and network infrastructure components are kept up-to-date with respect to patches. Timely patch application is one of the most significant actions that a system administrator can take to defend against intrusion attempts.</p></li><li><p>The computer systems and network infrastructure components are instrumented for host-based anomaly intrusion detection. This early warning technology helps the system administrator recognize when computer systems are under attack.</p></li><li><p>The selected authentication scheme is very strong, perhaps using some combination of one-time passwords and biometric identification. This attempts to reduce unauthorized access to a computer system and its services.</p></li><li><p>All network-based administrative activity uses strongly authenticated and encrypted connections. This attempts to reduce the unauthorized access and defends against inadvertent disclosure of the administrative session.</p></li><li><p>Physical survivability issues also need to be considered, such as uninterruptible power supplies and HVAC requirements. These need not be addressed in detail, but do need to be mentioned.</p></li></ol></div><p>In this example of Web servers, this Functional Unit architecture increases the likelihood that the servers are able to deliver their content to the Internet constituency in the face of attacks and failures. These include attacks affecting one or more of the information processes that separate the Web servers from those seeking service. System administrators learning the best practices of the day need to be taught about the goals of survivability and the state of the practices to achieve it, and then be challenged with real-world settings that allow them to hone their skills. This approach is reflected in the SIA curriculum. </p></div></body></html>
