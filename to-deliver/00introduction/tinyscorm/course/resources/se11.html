The SIA curriculum is based upon ten fundamental principles that are emphasized throughout each course. These principles form a foundation that extends beyond any specific technology or implementation. Technology changes over time and the education process must provide a basis for assessing new technologies as they become available. While specific technologies are used in labs and assignments, the foundational principles embodied in the curriculum are the key to meeting curriculum goals.</p><p>This course discusses topics (e.g., Risk Management, Security Policy, and Incident Handling) that require system administrator awareness but not necessarily in-depth expertise. It is important for you, as the SA, to know your job responsibilities in these topics. By understanding them, you learn what is traditionally considered "in scope" for the system administrator role. You are then better able to defer responsibilities beyond you scope to other organizational roles in an effective and professional manner.</p><p>For example, an enterprise in the early stages of formulating a security policy may give this entire task to the system administrator. Since policy formulation is an activity that should be sponsored by senior management and shared by many, assigning it solely to the system administrator will likely produce a product that neither meets business objectives nor represents all affected parties. The system administrator who knows that the process should have wide representation can attempt to guide efforts in this direction. This course describes the entire process and provides direction to the system administrator about their role within the process.</p><p>Similarly, managers also learn what tasks are in scope for the system administrators who work for them. Managers benefit because they don't assign tasks to system administrators that don't belong to system administrators. Both the manager and the system administrator have realistic expectations of their respective jobs.</p><p>As has been previously stated, the ten principles of survivability and information assurance are threaded throughout all of the courses in the SIA curriculum. To call attention to those places in the workbook where a principle is referenced, the text contains miniature versions of the principles graphics. The statement of the principle is also visually distinguished in the text.</p><p>For example, if a paragraph's topic was survivability where that principle was referenced, the statement of the principle would be shown as Principle 1: Survivability is an enterprise-wide concern and the graphic would be shown as an icon, typically to the left of the workbook text, as in this paragraph.</p><p>In this overview, we introduce the principles.  Then, in the next ten modules we address each one specifically in depth so you can gain a greater understanding and be able to apply them in your daily tasks.</p></div></body></html>
