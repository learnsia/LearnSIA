</p><p>System administrators secure access to information assets based upon user identification. The scheme an enterprise uses must have the following characteristics:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>It must be reliable. The scheme must identify the same user each time it is used.</p></li><li><p>It must be strong. The scheme must not allow user impersonation. Weak schemes such as those that use a login and password pair make impersonation too easy.</p></li><li><p>It must be usable. Users ultimately have to use an identification scheme. If it is too complicated, they.ll look for ways to get around it to do their jobs, usually sacrificing security.</p></li></ol></div><p>No matter how strong the information access technology, if it is based on weak user identification, it is effectively irrelevant. System administrators need to know that reliable, strong, and useable user identification is the foundation upon which restricting access to information assets is based. To achieve these goals, they need the appropriate technology and necessary policy to compliment that technology.</p><p>Computer systems and network infrastructure components also need to be identified in a reliable, strong, and usable manner. For example, the SA ought to know with a high degree of certainty that the computer system to which they are making a network connection is the one they believe it to be. Also, SAs must know that the information process attached to their network infrastructure are the only information process so attached, and that they have not been impersonated. Again, securing an organization requires appropriate technology and policy.</p></div></body></html>
