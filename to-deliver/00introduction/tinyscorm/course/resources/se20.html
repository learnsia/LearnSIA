</p><p>Throughout the SIA curriculum, you are challenged to think like an intruder including assessing the vulnerabilities of the technologies they are learning about. By looking for weaknesses, a SA begins to develop a more critical eye aimed at the deployed technologies as well as those used to achieve survivability and improve security.</p><p>The intent of this principle is not to train "hackers". Instead, the intent is to encourage SAs not to blindly accept a default implementation of a technology. By examining an implementation in depth, a SA can gain valuable experience that allows them to document their assumptions, a core part of their professional responsibilities.</p></div></body></html>
