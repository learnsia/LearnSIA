As a concept and as a practice, survivability should permeate all levels of an organization. Staff roles contribute differently to the overall goal of organizational survivability, from leadership, which makes decisions setting security policy, to system administrators, who recommend and install technology in support of survivability. An organization-wide understanding of the importance of survivability contributes to long-term growth and mission fulfillment.</p><p>Survivability permeates all levels of an enterprise, from the CEO/CIO level, where corporate direction is set, through middle management, where requests for capital are approved and the time needed to allow other levels to achieve survivability are accepted. Survivability also affects programmers, where programming for survivability is practiced, and systems administrators, where recommending and installing technology in support of survivability achieves the corporate goals.</p><p>System administrators need to know about survivability and how to engineer survivability into existing and new functional units, to the fullest extent possible. Survivability is much more real-time oriented than, for example, disaster recovery; a functional unit's constituency knows about disasters and what to expect when they occur. In contrast, intrusions and outages related to failures are typically unexpected. Organizations that do not anticipate them and plan accordingly can be adversely affected by their constituency's reactions to such an outage.</p></div></body></html>
