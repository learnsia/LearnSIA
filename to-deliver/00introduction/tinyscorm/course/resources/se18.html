</p><p>A systems administrator needs a structured approach to sustain and improve the survivability of SFUs and their constituent computer systems and network infrastructure components. The Security Knowledge in Practice [SKiP 02] method is such an approach. It is an iterative improvement method that structures and orders the CERT Security Improvement Practices [CERT c]. These practices are designed to improve the security of computer systems and networks during their complete lifecycle. The figure in the slide illustrates the SKiP method.</p><p>SKiP can be applied at the host level, the network architecture level, and at the SFU level. In practice, it should be applied at all levels. SKiP is explained at a high level in this course, and used to sustain, improve, and build SFUs in later courses of the SIA curriculum.</p><p>SKiP is the foundation for performing survivable systems administration. It helps the SA know what they are doing to an SFU, a computer system, and the network. Administrators can identify what steps in the process they have executed, where they are currently, and what to expect as their next set of actions.</p><p>SKiP is best applied after conducting a risk evaluation of an organization's information assets. Its instruction is preceded by a risk evaluation of the assets using the scenario devised as a teaching device.</p><p>The first step of the SKiP method, hardening, is applied at four levels: Data, Host, Network, and Internet. The Data level addresses confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues in greater detail. Access control devices such as access control lists, immutable files, and other techniques for limiting access are explored. Cryptography is examined in more detail. At the Host level, the curriculum explores authentication, logging, patching, and backups.</p><p>The Network and Internet levels are expanded into an entire major topic area, described in the next major section. This major topic area addresses the fundamentals of TCP/IP beginning with a simple network consisting of two computer systems with few requirements on networked services. The network is gradually made more complex as more information processes are attached and more requirements are made upon the systems and the network.</p><p>SKiP contains steps related to the incident handling process and these are part of the instructional foundation and the exercises in major topic area, .Sustaining, improving, and building Survivable Functional Units (SFUs).. The SA needs to know how to handle an intrusion while supporting an organization's business decisions with respect to intrusions (e.g., who to notify, when to take systems offline, and working with law enforcement and legal staff).</p></div></body></html>
