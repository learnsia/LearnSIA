In addition, survivability, <span class="bold"><strong>"the ability of a network computer system to provide essential services in the presence of attacks and failures and recover full services in a timely manner"</strong></span> is a new responsibility for the entire organization, including system administrators.</p><p>The Survivability and Information Assurance curriculum is based upon 10 principles that address these issues, extending beyond specific technologies or implementations that change over time. This course explores these principles in detail.</p></div></body></html>
