It lays the foundation for all of the other courses in the curriculum by applying the ten principles described here and highlighted in this module to TCP/IP-based networks and to the enterprise. Much as a highway is only as sound as the roadbed upon which it was built, the enterprise is only as sound-from a survivability and information assurance perspective-as the roadbed of principles used to build it. The principles of survivability and information assurance provide a firm, modern, and realistic roadbed for today and tomorrow's enterprise computer networks.</p><p>This course presents the ten principles of survivability and information assurance in detail. They are presented in a technology-independent way. It is of utmost importance for system administrators to grasp the fundamental issues of these principles independent of instances of technology that apply to them. The reason for this approach is that all too often system administrators view the set of problems they face and the solutions to those problems through the eyes of the technologies they know. This technology-constrained perspective limits the space of problems and issues that a system administrator can see.</p><p>Instead, a system administrator should always seek the fundamental issues of the problems that confront them. Those fundamental issues will be variations on the ten principles described in this course. Once the fundamental problem is understood, then and only then should technology be applied as a solution.
Therefore, the principles described here are independent of technology and you are strongly encouraged to understand them as presented. However, from time to time, applicable technologies will be highlighted where appropriate. These examples are marked with the following identifiers:</p><p>Contained between these two markers are references to instances of technology that are relevant to the discussion at hand.</p><p>"Principles of Survivability and Information Assurance" is broken into 11 modules-this introduction and one for each principle.  They have the following format, in most cases:
</p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td><span class="bold"><strong>Required readings</strong></span> - In some cases there are required readings that must be read before class time. These are intended to provide a basis for discussion during the lectures for that principle.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="bold"><strong>Recommended readings</strong></span> - If you want to know more, read these as well. They give you more background on the subject of the module. They are also a little longer and more technical in nature.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="bold"><strong>Quiz</strong></span> - The next section is the quiz section. Quizzes are short and are designed to strongly encourage you to read the required readings before class time. There is enough time to do the quiz if you have done the readings. Quizzes are noted with the following graphic:</td></tr><tr><td><span class="bold"><strong>Quiz review</strong></span> - Your instructor will tell you how quizzes are graded. No matter how that's done, the important concepts of quizzes are reviewed right after the quiz so that you have a good understanding for the rest of the module.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="bold"><strong>Topic in depth</strong></span> - The next part of the module varies in length from module to module. It examines the topic of the module in more detail.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="bold"><strong>Exam</strong></span> - The last section in each module is the exam. Your instructor will advise you as to how much time you are allowed for each exam. Exams are noted with the following graphic:</td></tr></table><p>"Principles of Survivability and Information Assurance" lays the groundwork for the rest of the courses in the SIA Curriculum. It is important that you learn these principles well so that you can apply them to the network and the whole of the enterprise.</p></div></body></html>
