</p><p>Everything in and around a computer system, network infrastructure component, and an SFU is data and that this perspective is useful [Rogers 02b]. The attributes of data that need to be considered and secured are the so-called InfoSec Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). The places where data reside and the general techniques that should be used to protect their CIA attributes are all defined in NSTISSI 4011: National Training Standard for Information Systems Security Professionals [NST 94]. Labs and demonstrations are used in this course to reinforce these techniques.</p><p>Data exists in storage, transmission, and processing, and all of these need to be explained and demonstrated through examples and labs. In some cases, this is a bit of a leap of faith in that not all of the necessary prerequisite information may have been explained by this point in the curriculum. For example, network sniffers, access control lists, encryption, and strong integrity checking are all technologies that are used to explain the technology. These topics are addressed in more detail later in the remaining courses of the SIA curriculum.</p></div></body></html>
