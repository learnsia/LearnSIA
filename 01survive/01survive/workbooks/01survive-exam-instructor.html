>You are the IT manager at XYZ Corporation. Your staff is responsible for maintaining the corporate network infrastructure (routers, switches, external network connectivity, etc.). You have started an initiative to increase survivability of the IT infrastructure. Your boss, the CIO, says "I thought we had a firewall and intrusion detection system. Why do we need any other security stuff?"</I

>Security is the defense of the CIA traits of information and systems where the end goal is simply that defense of the information, while survivability focuses on the ability of information to be available and protected within the context of the mission of the organization. Security is a component of survivability, but survivability is more focused on mission accomplishment.</B

>The costs of security are often considered overhead expenses. Survivability, however, has the end goal of successful mission accomplishment, and therefore is seen as an investment in the organization that brings tangible returns. The costs of survivability are all operationally sound since they involve the operations organizations of the enterprise and require input from those business units.</B
