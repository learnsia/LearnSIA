>Security policies define the rules that regulate how an enterprise manages and protects its information and computing assets to achieve security objectives. Security policies that are documented, well known, and visibly enforced establish expected user behavior and serve to inform users of their obligations for protecting computing assets. Users include all those who access, administer, and manage your systems and have authorized accounts on an enterprise's systems. They play a vital role in implementing security policies.</P
><P
>A policy must be enforceable to achieve its objectives. In most enterprises, the administrators responsible for the technological aspects of information security do not have the authority to enforce security policies. It is therefore necessary to educate management about security issues, the need for policies in specific topic areas such as acceptable use, and then to obtain a commitment to support the development, deployment, maintenance, and enforcement of those policies.</P

>Security requirements derive from an enterprise's mission and business objectives. These objectives provide a strategic understanding of what information assets need to be protected from compromise, damage, and loss. Performing risk management adds clarity and detailed guidance for information asset protection. Risk assessment (as part of risk management) is used to identify critical assets, identify threats to those assets, and formulate asset protection strategies based on identified risks. The presence of security policies demonstrates due diligence in the protection of information assets, which is critical for mitigating legal liability.</P
><P
>Using explicit and implicit security requirements and the enhanced understanding resulting from risk management processes, responsible parties can develop and maintain security policies and responsive infrastructure designs that satisfy these requirements.</P
><P
>Information assurance and security are requirements of infrastructure design, not "after the fact" add-ons. IA policies cannot be directly implemented; they are typically too high level. Policy requirements are further defined in standards, guidelines, and procedures. These artifacts are reflected in design decisions and are made real in an operational infrastructure through subsequent detailed design activities, development, and technology selection and implementation. There is a logical progression of actions for administrators to take; a roadmap can assist them in ordering and prioritizing such actions.</P
><P
>If an enterprise can make difficult strategic decisions about information assurance, it makes the subsequent implementation much easier. Sponsored, comprehensive, and up-to-date policies are critical in meeting an enterprise's IA requirements. There must be a clear, implementable, traceable path from policy specification to policy implementation. These artifacts enhance communication between administrators, security staff, executive management, and key stakeholders, and they provide a common understanding of the foundations required for more effective information assurance [Palmer 01].</P

>Federal, state, and local laws and regulations with which you need to comply are constantly evolving. New and updated technologies are regularly released. Intruder attack methods and the damage they cause are constantly evolving, posing new threats to your information assets. So as part of conducting normal day-to-day business, you need to have processes in place to keep IA policies and their implementation up to date. These changes serve as immediate, updated "marching orders" for the way the enterprise does business [Allen 01].</P
><P
>Having an effective IA policy in place should be considered a prerequisite for being in business. Buying and installing security solutions such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems while having bad policies or no policies is like having cops, courts, and prisons, but no laws [McBride 02].</P

Policies that are documented, well known, and visibly enforced establish expected user behavior and serve to inform them of their obligations for protecting the enterprise's information assets. Users include all those who access, administer and manage, or have authorized accounts on an enterprise's system. A policy must be enforceable to achieve its objectives.</P
><P
>Survivability polices are less defined and deployed than traditional security policies. As a result, we will concentrate on security policies, with the understanding that most of the practices are the same when developing and deploying policies that deal with overall mission survivability.</P
><P
>Information security policies define the enterprise's rules and expectations regarding access, protection, and accountability of information assets and resources. Security policies are imperative for a sound security implementation. Ideally, policies should be written first, followed by the implementation of technology to enforce them; however, this is often not the case. Federal, state, and local laws may require having policies in place on particular topics. Enacting key policies may be essential to survive a disaster. They may also provide protection from liability or negligence, and form a basis for establishing security controls.</P
><P
>Policies are considered the highest level of documentation from which standards, guidelines, and procedures derive. Ideally, higher-level policies are created first, ensuring alignment with business strategies and objectives. Effective policies are short, concise, and stated in such a manner that they do not need to change frequently.</P
><P

This is in addition to reserves required for credit risk. Digital security comprises a significant portion of operational risk. Firms that can demonstrate effective management of their e-business portfolio risk will be allowed to reduce the amount of operational set-aside. Therefore, better application security will-literally-be like money in the bank." [Jacquith 02].</P

>Policies are considered the first and highest level of documentation and are distinct from standards, guidelines and procedures. Standards, guidelines, and procedures contain the details of the policy, thereby interpreting and implementing policy. Generally, policies should be broad enough so that the underlying standards, guidelines, and procedures can be changed without having to change the overall policy.</P
><P
>These three elements of a policy are separate yet related. Many companies create one document that addresses all of these. However, each element serves a different function and is intended for different audiences so it is best to treat and package them separately. This modular approach eases the policy review and update process. </P

CLASS="emphasis"
>standard</B
></SPAN
> is typically a collection of system- or procedure-specific requirements that must be met by everyone [SANS 01].  Standards ensure the consistent deployment and uniform use of selected technologies. Using standards reduces unnecessary complexity that can be caused by numerous solutions to the same requirement. Standards often reflect an architectural or configuration baseline that is defined to ensure security is being implemented consistently throughout the enterprise. For example, "All systems shall use a Windows 2000 professional or later operating system and shall be configured to connect to the enterprise domain.," "All Windows 2000 servers shall be configured to only provide the services for which they are intended. All other services shall be disabled or deleted."</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>Guidelines</B
></SPAN
> are a collection of system or procedural recommendations for best practice [SANS 01]. They are not requirements to be met but are strongly recommended. Guidelines take into account the varying nature of information systems. Guidelines may be used to indicate how standards are developed. Effective security policies make frequent references to standards and guidelines that exist within an enterprise. For example, "To avoid losing data, all users should save their important files to their designated network directory/share at regular intervals (daily, weekly)."</P
><P
>Some policies, such as password policies, may include both standards and guidelines. Such guidelines are intended to be mandatory and carry consequences for non-compliance. An example policy that contains both standards and guidelines can be found at the following URL: http://www.sans.org/resources/policies/Password_Policy.pdf [SANS 05a]</P

>Procedures</B

The purpose of procedures, the lowest level in the policy documentation hierarchy, is to provide direction for implementing policies, standards, and guidelines. For example, procedures may include methods for proper handling of sensitive information and instructions for what to do in the event of an information security incident.</P
><P
>Well-documented procedures are critical to ensuring the survivability of an enterprise's information assets. Step-by-step instructions for routine tasks like system backups and restores, making changes to firewall access control rules, etc. should be followed, reviewed, and updated as needed. Having and using procedures provides continuity when key staff members depart.</P

Roles to be covered may include members of boards of directors or other oversight committees, executive and senior managers, middle managers, legal counsel, security officers, human resources, IT managers, and representatives of administrator and key user groups. Policies articulate the role and companion responsibilities that each of these positions has in ensuring that the policy is followed. They describe the enforcement mechanisms that are used to ensure that these roles and responsibilities are carried out. Policies should describe key decisions and scenarios in which authority to act is granted to specific roles.</P

>All users understand the part they are required to play in ensuring policy compliance. They understand and respect the consequences for non-compliance. To ensure user acceptance of any policies that require their compliance, you may consider requiring each user to sign a statement acknowledging that he or she understands the policy and agrees to follow it. The human resources department often administers this process. Users (including administrators) view effective IA policies as useful to their daily work, not as barriers to getting the job done.</P

This includes communication up and down the chain of command, and when, if ever, it is appropriate to bypass levels in the chain (vertical communication); notification of managers and peers at the same level (horizontal communication); the involvement of public relations for interfacing with the press and public; and communication with Internet service providers, help desk personnel, legal counsel, investigations groups, law enforcement agencies, and users. Mechanisms may include verbal conversations (phone, face-to-face), e-mail, pagers, and other forms of written correspondence such as fax, meetings, whether these occur onsite or offsite, and whether they require secure means of communication using various forms of encryption, scrambling, or jamming.

>The purpose of an acceptable use policy is to identify and encourage user behavior that can enhance security and discourage or prohibit user behavior that can reduce or breach security. Users need to know the information assets that require protection and their responsibilities with respect to that protection. The security of many computing assets (desktops, laptops, peripherals, personal digital assistants, etc.) and their access to an enterprise's infrastructure are ultimately the responsibility of users.

>Security is a requirement of infrastructure design, not an "after the fact" add-on. Security policies cannot be directly implemented; they are typically too high level. Policy requirements, reflected in design decisions, are made real in an operational infrastructure through subsequent detailed design activities, development, and technology selection and implementation. There is a logical progression of action for administrators to take. A plan can assist an administrator in ordering and prioritizing such actions.</P
><P
>Without a plan, policy implementers run the risk of deploying a piecemeal solution that only addresses specific needs, not the overall security architecture required to effectively meet policy requirements. Keep in mind the adage, "security is only as strong as its weakest link." Relying only on comprehensive perimeter protection in the form of firewalls and intrusion detection systems is an incomplete protection strategy with a historical precedent in the Maginot Line in World War II. Localized security technologies are a short-sighted, "fingers in the dike" solution and often result in crisis management and a high degree of vulnerability. The absence of a plan perpetuates erroneous thinking (the latest, hot security technology will protect our infrastructure from today's threats), wastes precious resources, and undermines an administrator's ability to make the case for improvement when the latest technology fails to protect in the face of a new attack.</P

>An administrator's security goals are largely determined by the following key tradeoffs [Fraser 97]:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Services offered versus security provided - Each service offered to users carries its own security risks. For some services, the risk outweighs the benefit of the service and the administrator may choose to eliminate the service rather than try to secure it.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Ease of use versus security - The easiest system to use allows access to any user and require no passwords; that is, there is no security. Requiring passwords makes the system a little less convenient but more secure. Requiring device-generated one-time passwords makes the system even more difficult to use, but much more secure.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Cost of security versus risk of loss - There are many different costs to security: monetary (i.e., the cost of purchasing security hardware and software like firewalls and one-time password generators), performance (i.e., encryption and decryption take time), and ease of use (as mentioned above). There are also many levels of risk: loss of privacy (i.e., the reading of information by unauthorized individuals), loss of data (i.e., the corruption or erasure of information), and the loss of service (e.g., the filling of data storage space, usage of computational resources, and denial of network access). Each type of cost must be weighed against each type of loss.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>An administrator needs to be fully cognizant of all security policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures and keep abreast of changes to these documents. In particular, administrators need to understand their role in ensuring policy compliance and identifying actions that violate policy. An administrator needs to take the initiative to raise questions of policy interpretation and ensure that policies exist to cover all actions for which an administrator is held responsible.</P
><P
>An administrator generally plays the role of technology expert and is likely the key implementer. As a result, an administrator needs to ensure that policy language is implementable and enforceable during the review process. An administrator will be increasingly involved as the policy language is interpreted and specified in more detail.</P
><P
>In <SPAN

CLASS="emphasis"
>Real World Linux Security: Intrusion Prevention, Detection, and Recovery</I
></SPAN
> [Toxen 01], Toxen says, "The degree of authority that an administrator should have to detect and correct policy noncompliance should depend on the criticality of the noncompliance. For example, a computer that provides an unauthorized and insecure bridge to the Internet around the firewall should be disconnected immediately, possibly impounded pending resolution and scanning for intrusions, and the user severely reprimanded or worse. An account used improperly or which contains software that has not been approved or unacceptable images should be disabled immediately by the administrator and then, when the system is secure, the administrator can follow up with the user and management as appropriate. If policy forbids personal e-mail, a gentle verbal warning following a violation is probably called for." [Toxen 01]</P
><P
>Often an administrator will be asked to participate in training users on how to comply with new policy actions and helping new administrators better understand their role and any constraints with respect to policy implementation and enforcement.</P

>As stated above under IA Policy Stakeholders and Contributors, administrators play the critical role of ensuring that policy language is clear and can be implemented at a reasonable cost. Administrators need to ensure that policy topics they require to do their jobs are included, and that they are comprehensive, complete, and accurate. One example is an administrator's authority to act in the event of a security incident (including different actions for different types of incidents) and where they need to obtain management concurrence before taking action (such as taking a system or network off line) [Wood 05b].</P
><P
>Administrators typically have an increased level of privilege (access, enforcement) over normal users. With this increased level of access comes greater responsibility, accountability, and authority. These rights and privileges need to be articulated in security policy language specifically directed to administrators. This policy should be carefully drafted and reviewed by administrators to ensure that it fully describes the rights and protections they require to perform their job responsibilities.</P
><P
>In addition to the above, here are three policy topics that administrators need to consider [Barman 02]:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Maintenance - Policies should require that administrators regularly maintain public data areas such as Web server content, ftp repositories, etc. Public data areas can serve as upload areas for hacker tools.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Outsourcing - Example language: Administrators shall be responsible for ensuring that servers providing information or services to Internet users are properly maintained. Servers operated by other providers (co-located or off-site) shall be maintained as specified in service level agreements.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Enforcement - Example language: Administrators shall enforce all policies in accordance with established procedures. Such procedures address monitoring and preserving information in a manner that allows appropriate action to be taken in the event of a policy violation. Such procedures include preserving evidence for disciplinary actions for employees and legal actions for external violators.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Other considerations for administrators that can result in policy non-compliance by administrators [Lancaster 03]:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Like the cobbler's children who have no shoes, system administrators often have no awareness of security requirements that apply to them. Well, more correctly, they often ignore such requirements. In fact, I can't tell you how many times I've seen security audits detect some outlawed application on the network, and then traced it back to an administrator's machine. As recently as two weeks ago, I was at a large company, where the head of their standards setting "Security Counsel" was running a Kazaa server on his workstation.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>One of the reasons this is true is that network administrators spend half their time building and tweaking and testing equipment, whether it's firewalls, PCs or routers and switches. And the other half of their time, they spend maintaining their networks with all sorts of specialized tools. These activities are very "high risk" and there are a lot of steps administrators should take to minimize their risk.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>First, build a lab or "build" a network, separate from your production network, in which you can build and test equipment, without worrying about what level of patches or service packs you have. Usually, you'll want to 'dual-home' a file server so that you can download necessary files, or better yet, burn the files you need to CDs. Using a Windows server to do "Port Address Translation" is also an option, as it can help prevent access into this private lab and only takes a few clicks to set up. This will help alleviate the problem of unauthorized programs running on administrators' workstations.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Next, get an accurate inventory of all your network management stations. Lots of administrators re-deploy old PCs to run network management tools like MRTG (multi-router traffic grapher) or to act as route servers or boxes to collect syslogs, etc. Unfortunately, these systems are highly susceptible to worms, as they are often overlooked when new patches are released; having a valid, up-to-date list will help with this problem.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Distributed or dedicated protocol analyzers, running on Windows OS are also vulnerable. Keep them updated, or shut them off when they're not in use. Finally, don't allow these boxes to belong to the same Windows Domain as your production servers.</P
