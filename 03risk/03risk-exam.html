>We prioritize assets so that the limited resources (funding, system/security administrator time, technology, support) can be applied efficiently to protect those assets. We must perform this type of activity to gauge what assets could cause an adverse impact to the organization upon failure (e.g., disclosure, modification, destruction, or interruption). An organization needs to determine which assets are most critical and warrant the greatest level of security investment.</B

>An organization needs to determine whether the enterprise would experience a large adverse impact if the asset were disclosed to unauthorized people (violation of confidentiality), modified without authorization (violation of integrity), lost or destroyed, or access to them was interrupted (violation of availability). In addition, an organization needs to articulate impact evaluation criteria to aid in this determination.</B
