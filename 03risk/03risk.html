>This module introduces the topic of risk management within the context of information assets. Not all data is of equal value to an enterprise. A key concept is being able to evaluate the relative importance of specific data (information assets) to fulfilling the mission and to prioritize security resources in accordance with an asset's criticality. To make effective asset protection choices, one must understand information assets, threats against these assets, vulnerabilities that can be exploited, impacts of vulnerability exploitation, and loss outcomes. There are risk evaluation and management approaches that system administrators need to understand, participate in, use to obtain risk mitigation strategies, and use to determine work priorities.</P

>The purpose of this lecture is to familiarize you with risk and asset management.  One of the key concepts is the determination and valuation of assets.  In most organizations, identifying and prioritizing assets based on their value, cost, or importance constitute this valuation and determination process.  This lecture focuses on an organization's ability to select and prioritize assets based on the asset's importance or relevance in fulfilling the mission and objectives, as well as impacts to the organization if the asset is compromised.</P
><P
>This lecture explains risk, risk impact, assets, asset categories, risk evaluation, and risk management.  It covers one recommended risk evaluation method (OCTAVE®), the potential impacts of risk events, and how to determine mitigation strategies for managing and reducing risk, as well as the administrator's role in these activities.</P

>Many organizations have contingency plans for dealing with business interruptions caused by natural disasters or accidents.  Although impacts resulting from the majority of cyberattacks are manageable, a cyberattack on an organization's critical networked information systems has the potential to cause severe and prolonged business disruption. This can occur whether the business has been targeted specifically or is a random victim of a broad-based attack.  If a cyberattack disrupts critical business functions and interrupts the essential services that customers depend upon, then the survival of the business may be at risk.  One example is the Web services offered by major banks.  If a bank's home page is defaced as part of a cyberattack, it likely decreases the confidence that patrons have in the bank's ability to safeguard their money.  These patrons may decide to move their money elsewhere.  Therefore, relatively benign attacks (from an operational standpoint) can cause significant damage to the overall business survivability of an organization.</P
><P
>One significant difference between disruptions caused by natural disasters and those caused by cyberattacks is that with a natural disaster a customer expects diminished service. A business disruption caused by a cyberattack likely is seen by enterprise customers as a sign of incompetence. Unless the cyberattack is widespread and well publicized, little customer sympathy is forthcoming [Lipson 99].</P
><P
>It is essential that survivability be treated holistically when managing IT systems and information assets.  Sustaining the mission of the organization is, after all, the primary motivation for investing in survivability components-not just protecting systems from intruders.</P

>Risk is the possibility of suffering harm or loss.  With respect to information, risk is the possibility of suffering a loss (or impact) due to disclosure, destruction, modification, or denial of access to the information.  Risk comprises an event (a threat scenario), a consequence (impact on the organization), and uncertainty (whether the threat scenario will occur). These risk impacts can directly affect security requirements-confidentiality, integrity, and availability-of the information as well as enterprise survivability and security.</P

>Threats to these critical assets (possibility of disclosure, modification, destruction, or interruption)</P
><P
>Vulnerabilities that may provide an opportunity for threats to be realized in a manner that discloses, modifies, destroys, or interrupts access to an asset</P
><P
>Before risks can be managed, they must be identified.  One way to examine for potential risk is to list the components of risk in an asset-driven scenario and gauge the risk's likelihood of occurrence.</P

>Example of Risk</B
></SPAN
></P
><P
>For example, let's consider a home user making a consumer purchase over the Internet.  In this situation, the user must submit customer information to the web site (i.e., item, quantity, name of customer, address of customer, payment type, credit card number, etc.) to complete the purchase. Therefore from the user's point of view, risk certainly exists, even if the user is not explicitly aware of the risk or is seemingly unconcerned. The asset at risk is the customer's information, the threat is anyone on the Internet with malicious intent, and the vulnerability is any technology weakness that allows the information to be observed and captured.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>How to Think About Risk Qualitatively</B
></SPAN
></P
><P
>Risks can be measured both qualitatively and quantitatively.  First, let's discuss the more straightforward and more commonly used qualitative approach. Qualitative measures of high, medium, and low provide the simplest means of assigning values to risk impacts. These measures provide enough of a benchmark to compare impacts across all critical assets. Qualifying risk means understanding the negative impact to the asset as well as the likelihood of the threat.  This impact occurs when the asset is disclosed, modified, destroyed, or access to the asset is interrupted.  To the home user in the scenario above, qualifying the risk means looking at the result and impact of having their personal information disclosed.  Users are probably most concerned with their financial exposure and liability, identity loss, and laws and regulations to which they may be subjected. Users can rate these concerns as high, medium, or low.</P
><P
>Quantifying the risk means determining the likelihood that the risk will occur.  Here the home user needs to consider the probability of someone performing several different attacks retrieve a user's personal information. This determination takes into account questions such as the following:</P
><A
NAME="AEN178"
></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
>How likely is it that someone may observe the information in transit between the home user and the Web site (and possibly decode any encrypted network traffic)?</P
><P
>How likely is it that the software handling personal information is vulnerable to attack?</P
><P
>How likely is it that this user will be singled out over all of the other web commerce transactions happening at the seller's web site?</P
><P
>How likely is it that an attacker might gain access to the information once it has arrived at the seller's Web site?</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><P
>These are a small sample of the potential risks in this simple transaction.  For the home user to understand these risks, he or she must appreciate the potential impact.  This rests on an understanding of potential threat sources (humans, system problems, viruses, etc.) that may exploit vulnerabilities manifest. This potential is a continuum ranging from negligible to actual, over the life of the information being transmitted, stored, and processed.</P

>Understanding a risk's impact forms the basis for evaluating outcomes of risk: loss, destruction, modification, and interruption. Impact is the realization of a risk.  To evaluate the outcome of a risk, we start by developing evaluation criteria for risk scenarios.</P
><P
>Let's consider a home user who sets up a personal web server to display his or her resume.  To manage risk, our home user identifies his or her assets, considers the possible negative outcomes, and characterizes the impact of an asset being compromised.  Here, our home user recognizes that one asset is the web server while another is the resume file.  Selecting the resume, the possible negative outcomes to this information asset include the following:</P

></LI
><LI
><P
>Destruction, causing an expenditure of effort to recover or recreate the information</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Modification, causing a prospective employer to consider the candidate either adequate or inadequate for the position, depending on what information was changed</P

></LI
><LI

><P
>Finally, the home user must evaluate the impacts, deciding whether he or she really cares about the potential impacts to the assets involved.

></SPAN
></P
><P
>If an organization chooses to accept risk, it does so with full knowledge of the potential threats and vulnerabilities to the asset.  It may be that the asset's exposure is acceptable or within some level tolerance. For example, an organization recognizes the threat that usernames and passwords could be compromised by administering systems remotely with Telnet, a text-in-the-clear protocol. However, the organization decides that the risk is not great enough to warrant a control (such as encrypted sessions with SSH or IPsec).</P
><P
><SPAN

><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>Mitigate</B
></SPAN
></P
><P
>Mitigating risk is actively applying controls to reduce the asset's level of exposure.  In the above Telnet example, the organization could mitigate the risk by (a) denying all administrative traffic to the remote systems that is not encrypted and authenticated, and (b) writing an organizational policy that acts as a deterrent (such as any attempt to compromise access controls on enterprise systems will be met with severe disciplinary action).</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>Transfer</B
></SPAN
></P
><P
>Transferring risk occurs when an organization decides to contract with a third party to mitigate the risk. However, keep in mind that the organization continues to own the risk. For example, an organization can transfer the risk of losing data (and support the goal of mission survivability) by contracting with a service provider who maintains an offsite data backup and recovery capability.  Although risk transference does not change probability or severity of a threat, it may decrease the probability or severity of the organization's risk exposure. At a minimum, the organization's risk exposure is greatly decreased or eliminated because the possible losses or costs are shifted to another entity.</P

>Because you cannot identify, let alone mitigate, all risks, at some point you have to trust someone or something to take the appropriate action or to function as designed.  For example, you may have to trust people, systems, or programs to handle and operate on information in a manner that meets its security requirements.</P
><P
>If an organization has transferred risk mitigation to another party such as a managed security service provider (MSSP), the risk has not been completely removed.  The client organization must trust in the effectiveness of the MSSP.  As a result, there is still a residual risk that the MSSP may not be able to meet the expectations of the client all of the time.  The responsibility (and consequences) of transferred risks are still retained by the organization.</P
><P
>Historically, programming and computer science have been taught in an environment that assumes that trust exists.  As a result, most systems and software currently deployed are not designed to sufficiently guard against breaches of trust that threaten information survivability.</P
><P
>Do not place blind trust in the individuals and technology that protects information assets. Implement monitoring controls for the risk you have accepted as well as the risk that you currently mitigate.  In fact, monitoring accepted or transferred risks works in the same fashion as monitoring known, mitigated risks.  For monitoring to be effective, risks that are managed or accepted must again be documented and understood by the organization and its employees.</P

>Identifying assets involves a discussion within the organization to determine what categories of assets exist, who owns each asset, and what level of protection is necessary for each asset. This exchange of information should happen between the managers, staff, and IT personnel on a periodic basis and as part of the organization's review of its information security policy.  These events enable the organization to identify its current protection strategy for each asset and any changes to the asset's priority as seen by different levels of the organization. Assets may be mission critical, non-critical but sensitive, or general in nature. This discussion aids in prioritizing assets and it should be documented and reflected in organizational policy, procedures, standards, and guidelines (see <SPAN

>Identifying asset threats and vulnerabilities is part of a risk evaluation activity and requires that those who are responsible for protecting the information assets have an appreciation of the range of threats and vulnerabilities.  Once the range is understood, the likelihood of any one threat acting adversely on an asset must be identified.</P
><P
>The results of a risk evaluation include protection strategies (plans, policies, technological mechanisms) that will help to mitigate identified risks.  For example, an identified risk for a medical organization may be that "modification of paper medical records by unauthorized individuals can lead to loss of life, financial or punitive penalties, or loss of customer confidence."  This risk is stated as a risk scenario that identifies the critical assets (paper medical records), threats to the asset (personnel exceeding their privileges or unauthorized outsiders), outcome (modification of the records), and impact (public safety, financial, customer confidence, legal).  Risk evaluation determines which risks need to be considered and a qualitative measure of their impact (high, medium, low).</P

Assets can be categorized as information assets (for example, business and customer data), technology assets (hardware, software), and supporting assets (facilities, utilities, services).  Assets in any of these categories may be identified as critical, that is, most important.</P
><P
>Your organization may choose to categorize assets according to sensitivity or function.  Asset definitions can be highly subjective and asset value even more so. Therefore, another way to approach assets and asset value is to consider the worth of the asset in both quantitative and qualitative terms. By examining an asset's value (qualities of the asset's presence and absence), you may discover a more meaningful categorization approach.</P

>The Information Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA) of 1996 is also known as the Clinger Cohen Act and primarily affects federal government agencies.</P
><P
>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1997 addresses the handling of patient information. Many academic institutions have associated medical facilities and student health centers so are subject to HIPAA.</P
><P
>The Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 requires certain commercial Web sites to obtain parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13.</P
><P
>The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 applies to financial institutions and protects customer data and privacy.</P
><P
>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was created in response to accounting improprieties such as Enron's. CEOs and CFOs are required to inform their directors of significant internal control deficiencies that could adversely affect their ability to report financial data. "Major accounting firms now recommend that clients disclose their security plans in much the same way they disclose financial performance" [Leibs 03]</P
><P
>Per Dave McCurdy, EIA president, directors' and officers' insurance rates double after the Enron indictment</P
><P
>A California law (effective 7/1/03) requires businesses that own databases to disclose security breaches if certain personal information was or may have been compromised. [A number of other states have enacted or are considering enacting similar laws.  See http://www.pirg.org/consumer/credit/statelaws.htm#breach for information.]</P
><P
>"Expected to come into force in 2004, the Basel II Capital Accords require financial services firms to explicitly set aside cash reserves to cover operational and market risk. This is in addition to reserves required for credit risk. Digital security comprises a significant portion of operational risk. Firms that can demonstrate effective management of their e-business portfolio risk will be allowed to reduce the amount of operational set-aside. Therefore, better application security will - literally - be like money in the bank." [Jacquith 02]</P
