>This module introduces the topic of risk management within the context of information assets. Not all data is of equal value to an enterprise. A key concept is being able to evaluate the relative importance of specific data (information assets) to fulfilling the mission and to prioritize security resources in accordance with an asset's criticality. To make effective asset protection choices, one must understand information assets, threats against these assets, vulnerabilities that can be exploited, impacts of vulnerability exploitation, and loss outcomes. There are risk evaluation and management approaches that system administrators need to understand, participate in, use to obtain risk mitigation strategies, and use to determine work priorities.</P

>Prior to class have the students read both the short "OCTAVE® Information Security Risk Evaluation" and Introduction to the OCTAVE® Approach.  Ideally, the students would also read "Security: Technical, Social, and Legal Challenges" and "Understanding Risk", but these last two articles are not freely available on the Internet and thus will require not only permission to use, but in all likelihood a fee to use.</P
><P
>Use the Sample OCTAVE® Scenarios file for in-class examples and homework-note that this file contains sample answers also. These scenarios can be used for discussion, as a class demonstration, or individual or small groups work inside or outside of class.  The OCTAVESM Catalog of Practices, Version 2.0 document is a handout later in this module-in the discussion with respect to Phase 1 Process S1-Evaluate Organizational Security Practices slide. Finally, the OCTAVE<SUP
>SM</SUP
> Method Implementation Guide Version 2.0 Volume 17:Appendix C: Complete Example  [Alberts 01c] contains a complete worked example.</P
