>The Security Knowledge in Practice (SKiP) Method defines a continuous process for establishing and sustaining the security of a critical information asset. One example is the traditional computer system-part of an SFU-that runs mission critical applications. In addition, the SKiP Method can be applied to the architecture of a network, the systems that comprise a sub-infrastructure (e.g., the collection of computer systems that provide electronic mail or remote access services), and computers installed at home.</P

>5 hours. This is an important topic so time spent here is time well spent.</P
><P
>The SKiP Method is a way to administer computer systems and can be applied from cradle to grave. It was designed to be process oriented rather than task oriented and is a benefit to the novice SA as well as the seasoned professional. The key is that the SA should know where they are in the method at all times. If they know where they are, they will know what they should be doing and their time and effort can be channeled appropriately.</P
><P
>SKiP came to be when we at the CERT Training and Education Center wanted to make the wealth of information in the CERT Security Improvement Modules available to a broader audience. By defining a process, we intended to ground novice system administrators in a method for managing their computer systems to help them address tasks that they might not have otherwise known they faced.</P
><P
>SKiP was originally designed to address the task of administering computer systems. Along the way, we learned that it is also applicable to routers and firewalls (which are basically stripped down computer systems) and the architecture of a network.</P
><P
>This set of lectures explains the SKiP Method and how to apply SKiP to a computer system. There are few exercises here. Instead, in "Sustaining, Improving, and Building Survivable Functional Units (SFUs)", the SKiP Method is demonstrated on one of the computer systems in the enterprise. Students then follow the SKiP Method steps when they re-engineer the computer systems and network infrastructure components that are part of the Functional Units assigned to their group.</P
><P
>The SANS reading room (http://www.sans.org/reading_room/" has numerous papers and tutorials that address the areas discussed in this lecture.  Students should review the website to become familiar with the various topics and subject matter available on the site.  It will be an invaluable source during their studies and as they advance through the SIA curriculum.  The available papers on the SANS site are always being updated as more security professionals become certified in the various certification tracks available on their site (http://www.giac.org/).</P
><P
>In the mean time, there are sections in the text bracketed by markers that list representative technologies that support the SKiP Method step being described. These are included in an attempt to satisfy the technology cravings of the students who want to know more during this course. The markers are denoted as follows:</P

></DIV
></P
><P
>At this time, there is not the wealth of technology to carry out all of the steps of SKiP, particularly in the Prepare step with respect to Characterization. While there are mature applications available for characterizing changes to files and folders (e.g., OSSEC), when it comes to characterizing process behavior and the kernel, there are few candidates. It is important to highlight this fact and to encourage students to be on the lookout for new applications that may help them do these characterizations. I encourage you, the instructor, to do this also and use the applications that you discover to augment the Technology Timeout information presented herein. The students need to know what tasks they need to address and the nature of the applications that will help them, even if specific implementations are not yet available.</P

>The SKiP Method is a new way to think about system administration. Unlike previous system administration methods, the SKiP Method defines seven specific and ordered steps, and the actions to be taken at each step. Once the SA is comfortable with the SKiP Method and its steps, these steps are repeated over and over for the life of the system to which they are applied.</P
><P
>The SKiP Method was designed to organize information security practices published on the CERT Web site1 into a more contiguous process-based approach, departing from the more common problem-based approach. The process diagram shows the sequence of activities that comprise SKiP.</P
><P
>For the less experienced SA, SKiP gives a roadmap of the major tasks to build and sustain the security of a system. For more experienced SAs, SKiP provides an ordered arrangement and a checklist of practices, allowing administrators to identify gaps in the tasks they are already performing.</P

>The purpose of the SIA Curriculum is to teach system administrators how to manage an existing network of cooperating computer systems and network infrastructure components according to the ten principles described in "Principles of Survivability and Information Assurance".

>In the best of all possible worlds, the "right" computer system, matched with the "right" operating system and the "right" application would constitute the best practice for building and installing a computer system or a network infrastructure component that are part of an SFU. For example, if a Dell server running the Red Hat Linux operating system and using the Apache Web Server is the best possible environment for hosting a Web server, then SAs should be proficient in both making this recommendation/decision and installing and operating such a system. In addition, the SAs' managers need to be willing to allow their administrators to learn about the best technology practices and support their decisions through technology purchases.</P
><P
>With this kind of knowledge, SAs would be free to make the best choices when selecting hardware and software technology. <SPAN

CLASS="emphasis"
>Principle 8: The road map guides implementation choices (all technology is not equal</B

>At this point, it's important for the students to understand what the vendors provide in the systems that they ship these days. The vendors' goals differ significantly from SA's goals. It seems as though the vendors seek to have customer support telephone/e-mail/Web interactions be virtually nil, and they seek to achieve that by selling fully functional systems that "work" in almost all settings. The customer opens the shipping boxes, installs the software, and everything just works.</P
><P
>SAs who are in tune with survivability and information assurance issues want something different. They need to improve the survivability of the systems they install. To do this, they need to apply a method such as the SKiP Method to the computer systems and network infrastructure components that their enterprise purchases.</P
><P
>The scales are tilting slowly toward more secure systems as distributed by the vendors. SAs are getting some relief but not enough yet so that they can rest easy. There's still a lot that needs to be done to the computer systems and network infrastructure components that vendors provide to make them sufficiently survivable in today's enterprise network.</P

>Principle 6: Survivable Functional Units (SFUs) are a helpful way to think about an enterprise's networks</B

From this design, specific applications running under specific operating systems on specific computer systems have been identified, purchased, delivered, and are now awaiting installation and tuning at the hands of the SA. That's the easy part.</P
><P
>The hard part - or perhaps merely harder - is actually doing the work in a way that promotes the survivability of the organization's mission and assuring that the information provided by those applications running on the SFU's computer systems are properly managed. The SKiP Method is a method that defines a process that system administrators can use to improve organizational survivability and information assurance at the infoprocs level.</P

>This section uses an analogy likening a computer system to a piece of wood. The applications distributed with that computer system and network infrastructure components are the hammers, wood chisels, and other applications used by SAs to shape that piece of wood to fit its use in the SFU in the enterprise.</P
><P
>While some of these applications are needed for the system to even function, many others are provided to accommodate the demand for an "any-purpose" computer system. This "one size fits all" mentality is precisely what we are asking vendors for by purchasing their products and by not asking for something different, (i.e., a product that operates securely). Once SAs and other customers start demanding a more secure system product-that is, voting with their dollars-the responsibility for adjusting the "shape" of the product will shift from the SA to the vendor.</P
><P
>In the meantime, the SAs' role is to identify the tasks that will be performed by the computer system or network infrastructure component and then determine the necessary (minimum essential) functions needed to meet the organization's goals, eliminating those that are unnecessary. In many respects, the design of the SFU has defined the functions that the computer system or network infrastructure component should perform.</P
><P
>Shaping a computer system or network infrastructure component to meet the needs of the SFU in the enterprise is challenging, especially for the novice. The SKiP Method makes this security task more orderly and manageable. It helps SAs to keep their focus on the job at hand, namely installing and operating a computer system or network infrastructure component that is part of an SFU that supports the mission of the enterprise.</P
><P
>To better understand the types of products that vendors provide these days, read the following excerpt from Rich Pethia's September 26, 2001 Congressional Testimony [Pethia 01], in which he comments on the state of software systems developed and sold in today's market. Please note that this statement given by Rich Pethia, Director of the CERT, to Congress was in "2001." The CERT stopped publishing their vulnerability statistics, but at last count they cataloged 6,508 vulnerabilities in 2008 (http://www.cert.org/stats/). In a testimony to congress by Dr. Greg Shannon, Chief Scientist for the CERT, Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, on July 24, 2011 he reported the CERT cataloged approximately 250,000 "malicious artifacts." The testimony below, by Rich Pethia, is left here to emphasis the points he make regarding the state of the security of software and the need for vendors to incorporate security in their development processes. Some vendors have been taking a proactive approach to security and redesigning their software with strong security features and controls enabled by default. Have a look at the vulnerabilities listed in BugTraq to further point out the problems of the same vulnerabilities affecting software.</P

>Last year (2000), the CERT/CC received 1,090 vulnerability reports, more than double the number of the previous year. In the first half of 2001, we have already received 1,151 reports and expect well over 2,000 reports by the end of this year. These vulnerabilities are caused by software designs that do not adequately protect Internet-connected systems and by development practices that do not focus sufficiently on eliminating implementation flaws that result in security problems.</P
><P
>There is little evidence of movement toward improvement in the security of most products; software developers do not devote enough effort to applying lessons learned about the sources of vulnerabilities. We continue to see the same types of vulnerabilities in newer versions of products that we saw in earlier versions. Technology evolves so rapidly that vendors concentrate on time to market, often minimizing that time by placing a low priority on the security of their products. Until customers demand products that are more secure or there are changes in the way legal and liability issues are handled, the situation is unlikely to change.</P
><P
>Additional vulnerabilities come from the difficulty of securely configuring operating systems and applications software packages. These products are often shipped to customers with security features disabled, forcing the technology user to go through the difficult and error-prone process of properly enabling the security features they need. While the current practices allow the user to more quickly use the product and reduces the number of calls the product vendor's service center might receive when a product is released, it results in many Internet-connected systems that are incorrectly configured from a security standpoint.</P

Given the problems with what the vendor provides, the installation needs to take place in a safe environment, because a partially built system is likely vulnerable to attack.

>The SA now knows that vendors provide imperfect systems that can be thought of as blocks of wood to be tailored to meet the needs of the SFU of which they are a part. How is a system installed, given that what is installed is likely vulnerable to attack?</P
><P
>SAs need to install the vendor-provided software in an environment where the vulnerabilities cannot be exploited by intruders and where the computer system can be tailored to meet the needs of the SFU. Among the possible environments are the following:</P
><P
>An air-gapped test network - This is a network where only a very few computer systems are installed. They probably contain software to be used in subsequent steps in the SKiP Method but they are not otherwise part of your production environment. The network is not connected to any other network, hence the name air-gapped. This reduces the likelihood of intrusions because physical security techniques are used to guard these computer systems as they are being built. Examples of physical security techniques are locked doors and guarded buildings.</P
><P
>Part of the challenge of an air-gapped network is making applications and patches available to other computer systems and network infrastructure components on that network. One way to solve this problem is to burn these applications and patches onto a CD and then physically transport that CD to the air-gapped network. Later in this class, you will learn about assumptions and how to challenge them. The issues here are that applications and patches transported by CDs from one network to another are assumed to be more secure than other methods. This means that an air-gapped test network is the best practice for building and tailoring computer systems that are intended to be part of SFUs, given that what the vendors provide are general-purpose systems with security gaps (holes).</P
><P
>A tightly controlled test network - This is a network that is connected to the Internet or some other network in a very tightly controlled manner, such as through a network router that grants very specific minimal access. It's easier to get applications and patches. It's easier to use but not quite as secure as the air-gapped version.</P
><P
>A production network - This is a network with full Internet or other network access. The computer systems will eventually reside on this type of network when they are in production. Access to applications, patches, intrusion detection systems, etc. is as easy as access is from a production system. This is the least secure but easiest to use for installation and tailoring.</P
><P
>Of these, the best environment is the air-gapped test network, where the opportunity for intrusion is smallest. This topic is discussed in more detail next.</P

>The first step in the SKiP Method is hardening and securing that system against known threats and vulnerabilities. This section describes a set of tasks that SAs perform as well as the philosophies behind those tasks. The philosophies are important because the current list of threats and vulnerabilities continues to grow, unfortunately almost daily. This means that SAs must supplement the information presented here to address the latest tasks when hardening a system.</P
><P
>The hardening and securing tasks described here must not be considered complete. Successful SAs will continuously research what hardening and securing means for the operating system and applications they support as more vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies are publicized. Keeping up to date is very important.</P
><P
>When installing an operating system or applications, there is likely an amount of hardening and securing of that OS or application that goes on simply by the nature of that installation process. It is difficult to split the two cleanly. The point is to realize that even the installation process contains some hardening and securing efforts. One example would be installing only the software deemed necessary was installed during the build phase as opposed to installing all software and then removing what is not needed.</P

Report on three of the tasks by writing a procedure for each task that someone else could follow. Reference the hardening/securing list when writing the procedure.</P
><P
>The task of hardening and securing seeks to shape a computer system or network infrastructure component to meet an organization's security requirements for the SFU of which the system is a part. Given the vendors' propensity to provide fully featured and general-purpose systems, the SA must remove and constrain the excess software that is part of today's operating systems and applications. Much like the master crafter who transforms a block of wood into a smooth carving, an administrator must carve out of the general-purpose services and features provided by the vendor those that are unneeded, retaining only what is needed to address a specific business need. By removing unnecessary functionality, an administrator begins to harden and secure the system. But hardening and securing also means taking what is known today and applying it to best implement the applications in use today. In other words, simply sculpting the wood to limit functionality is not enough; the wood carver must also realize that wood is susceptible to the environment and needs to be stained and treated. Similarly, administrators need to configure functions and applications correctly to sustain a stable and secure configuration.</P
><P
>This step strengthens a system against known attacks by eliminating (where possible) vulnerabilities and other weaknesses that are commonly used in known attacks. The practices performed during this step will change over time to address new attacks and vulnerabilities.</P
><P
>An overview of the hardening and securing practices (each to be addressed in detail):</P

></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Install only the minimum essential operating system features. Disable and remove unneeded vendor software. The fewer software services on a system, the harder it is to access that system through whatever means are available. For example, remove the FTP server and client if the system is not expected to need or provide FTP service.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Install all known and applicable patches that correct known deficiencies and vulnerabilities. This is a task that changes over time with each new patch released by operating system and application vendor.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Install the most secure and current versions of system applications.</P

></LI
><LI
><P
>Install and replace applications that support other SFUs. Examples are authentication, logging, backup and restore, and file service access.</P
></LI
><LI

>Install applications to support the other steps in SKiP. Examples are applications that scan for viruses, characterize a system's behavior (OSSEC3), detect some types of intrusions through anomalies (also OSSEC) and signature recognition (SNORT4), perform secure administration (SSH), and forensic analysis (The Coroner's Toolkit also known as TCT5).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Remove all privileged and lenient (too weak or open) object access. This follows the principle of "deny first, then allow." Grant privileges and access only as needed.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Install and configure all operating system features and applications that support organizational policy and procedures. For example, configure the user password selection mechanism to check candidate passwords and well-known variations ('0' used in place of the letter 'o', '3' used in place of the letter 'e', etc.) against a dictionary that may also contain enterprise-specific words, phrases, and acronyms. The organizational policy may also define minimum password length and composition. For example, a password may be required to contain a minimum of 8 letters (Uppercase and lowercase), 2 numbers, and 1 special character (comma, period, exclamation mark, question mark, etc).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Install and configure all operating system features and applications that support risk management. For example, a critical information asset may be of such a value to the enterprise that it must always be encrypted when it resides on a disk or backup media.</P
></LI

>Remember to do the hardening and securing tasks on a computer system that is attached to an air-gapped test environment (AGTE) as was previously described. This minimizes opportunities to compromise the system while it is being built.</P
><P
>There are many free guides available on the Internet. Even guides that are targeted for older versions of operating systems are still useful because they help the SA think about the issues to be considered when hardening and securing a computer system or network infrastructure component. It is important to state again that the SA needs to keep up-to-date with these and other resources, given that the hardening and securing tasks change over time.</P

>Most houses usually have more than one door, though only one is considered the "front" door. Because of this, homeowners have more than one entrance they need to secure. Certainly this security task would be easier if there were only one door. However, that presents other problems, such as having alternate exits in case of fire. More doors represents a tradeoff between a more secure configuration (only one door) and a more useable or practical configuration (multiple doors).</P
><P
>Computer systems have some of the same issues. For example, having all available software and packages on a system may make it easier to diagnose and repair problems and they may provide more options when configuring a system. But, the more software there is, the more opportunities there are for vulnerabilities that can be exploited by intruders to gain unwanted or undeserved access. So, the idea is to install only the minimum software necessary for a computer system to achieve is designed goal, and nothing more.</P

>One way to approach this is to run the system in a production mode, see the list of programs and applications used, and then eliminate all else. Another way is to load the absolute minimum and subsequently add what is missing. It is a bit of an art and can be laborious, but remember that the fewer the doors, the fewer things to secure and the more secure the system is.</P
><P
>Some operating systems make installing only the minimally required software much easier. Other systems are not packaged this way so installing only the minimal software needed to support the computer system's role in its parent SFU is harder.</P

>Most Linux versions are distributed with hundreds of smaller packages that give the system administrator more fine grained control over the applications installed on a computer system. For example, the SSH server is a separate package that contains just the server, the necessary configuration files and enabling scripts, and documentation. The SSH client is packaged separately. So, if the requirements of the computer system specify the need for the telnet client but not the server, this is easily achieved with a Linux-based system.</P

>Where possible, select an operating system that can be easily tailored to install only the needed software. No matter which operating system is ultimately selected, use the facilities available to install only what's needed to operate that system. At this point it may seem like an inconsequential decision, but as computer systems evolve, the ability to easily maintain them impacts the total cost of ownership of those systems.</P

>Patch management is a significant problem in today's environment. Installing patches is important, it's true, but it's a huge problem to administer the patching method used by the enterprise. It is further complicated by the growing number of computer systems attached to the enterprise's network. That point needs to be stressed with the students.</P
><P
>Patches are going to be with us for a while and successful system administrators need to get them under control-whatever that means-sooner rather than later. Perhaps reviewing some of the patching methodologies and applications that can make the process smoother would be a good assignment for the students. Installing patches and configuration management go hand-in-hand.</P

>If you learned that an ordinary screwdriver could easily defeat the lock on your front door, what would you do? You'd probably replace it with a different lock that could withstand that type of threat, especially if you felt that it was a true concern. Hopefully, you wouldn't wait until someone took advantage of this vulnerability in your house before you responded.</P
><P
>The same principle also applies to a computer system. In fact, 95 percent of all network intrusions could be avoided by keeping a computer system up to date by applying patches proactively (that is, before an intruder takes advantage of them).</P
><P
>There's no question that keeping patches up to date is often a hard and time-consuming task, especially if patching a system means visiting each computer system. Imagine walking around a site, visiting each and every workstation, installing needed patches after cajoling each user to log off. At 20 minutes per computer system, it would take more than 40 days to patch 1,000 computers. It's no wonder that organizations with this type of setup have systems that are often not patched. Even if patches aren't installed separately for each user, just keeping current with available patches and finding time to install them is a challenge.</P
><P
>What happens on those systems once they are patched? Do the applications that worked before still work? Can this be known in advance? If there is a problem, can the offending patch be successfully "backed out"? Unfortunately, this question is hard to answer because application vendors don't always provide enough information. Sometimes it seems easier to avoid patching systems altogether and just tighten perimeter defenses instead.</P
><P
>Since applications are the lifeblood of business, security is often sacrificed to keep the business running. This may mean that patches are not installed. Ultimately, the business will suffer, though perhaps not in the short term. In the long term, the potential harm that an organization will experience may be greater than the harm caused by installing patches earlier and discovering incompatibilities sooner.</P
><P
>Remember the old oil filter commercial tag line: "You can pay me now or pay me later"? (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fram_%28oil_filter%29) The commercial reminded people that the low cost of an oil filter-less than $10-could save them the cost of a new engine later-often over $1,000. Contrast the cost of installing a patch and perhaps discovering an application incompatibility with the cost of managing and recovering from an intrusion. At least when a new engine is installed in a vehicle, it will be drivable again and the driver will be able to get back to the business at hand. Recovering from an intrusion is not so straightforward. It is possible that an organization won't be able to recover from an intrusion quickly or completely. It may even put them out of business!</P
><P
>Nonetheless, patch wherever and whenever possible. When it's not obvious that a patch can be installed without serious repercussions, contact the vendor and ask. The more SAs who ask these questions of vendors, the more likely those vendors will make their products work on patched systems and, perhaps, publicize their efforts-the best of both worlds.</P
><P
>New vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited every day. For the systems, network components, and software used in your organization, it is important to stay abreast of reports regarding vulnerabilities and their solutions. Applicable security patches and workarounds should be applied and deployed as soon as possible and practical.</P
><P
>The list of patches to install also evolves over time. New vulnerabilities requiring new patches appear seemingly daily. Older versions of patches become obsolete. Superimposed on this set of patches are incompatibilities with applications that support the mission of the enterprise. All of these factors impact how patches are applied to the computer systems and network infrastructure components that make up SFUs that support the enterprise.</P

Newer versions are also believed to be the beneficiaries of the "lessons learned" from earlier versions and other software development activities. Finally, it is also believed that newer versions of applications receive the most attention when bugs are found. Therefore, the harden/secure suggestion is to install the latest version of applications that support the mission of the SFU of which a computer system is a member.</P

>As will be discussed in more detail later in this lecture, a program runs with a set of credentials that identify the entity (logged in user) and a set of rights and privileges to which that user is entitled. The key is to minimize the access that a program, operating on behalf of the user, has to information resources on a computer system (e.g., the file system, functions within the kernel, access to the network, etc.). For now, the issue is the task of determining the set of information resources accessed by a program.</P

The information resources that programs use (files and directories/folders) and the way they are used (read, write, and execute) must be determined through brute-force techniques.

If that changed form falls into the wrong hands, it is of no use without access to the algorithms and the keys used to perform the encryption since the algorithms are normally available. The challenge then is to safeguard the keys used by the encryption algorithms. In fact, since encryption algorithms have become so computationally complex, intruders have turned their efforts to stealing the keys and away from brute-force cracking.</P

In some cases, where no lock, latch or other device could be installed, the security system is the only means of defense.</P

>On a computer system, the host-based firewall is analogous to the home security system. It is another defense beyond the specific connection constraints installed at the host level as just discussed. Firewalls can also add constraints at the operating system level when none can be added at the application level. Finally, with host-based firewalls, the administrator can eliminate connections to services that have been disabled and subsequently removed as another way to insure that the service remains disabled, even if the supporting files are reinstalled and the service restarted.</P

>To simplify the increasingly complex task of securing information assets, think of all information as input that is consumed by an information processor (i.e., the operating system or a program) through a service (the file system, a Web server, e-mail server, etc). That information can be protected in two fundamental ways:</P
><P
>Restricting access - Only those who can operate on the information (i.e., read, write, append, execute, etc.) are allowed, and all other operations by all other users are excluded. On a computer system, this is achieved with the access control devices known as access lists. They come in a variety of types, from those traditionally associated with the file system, to special types of files and hardware controls. Access controls are also used at the network level, where network data is exposed to only those hosts and network segments as needed. All of these access control devices restrict access to the information assets they are guarding.</P
><P
>Concealing information - With this type of access control device, other users may be able to see the concealed form of the asset but only a few can translate it into a usable form. On a computer system, this is achieved through encryption, be they assets that reside on storage media, transiently on the network, or in the address space of a running application. The information must be strongly encrypted such that the time to decrypt it require more time elapsed time than the useful lifetime of that asset. This means that by the time that the asset is decrypted its unencrypted form is no longer useful.</P
><P
>When the host resides on a network, that host computer system must be evaluated with respect to the services it provides to that network. Every service must be accounted for, and either disabled and removed from the system, or configured to constrain the set of computer systems that can use that service. There are various programs that can be used to enumerate the set of services that a host provides, from both the host and the network perspective.</P
><P
>No matter the disposition of the service, the way in which it is started must be clearly identified. If the service is to be disabled, the instantiation method must be changed to disable the service. If it is to be constrained, the instantiation method may be changed depending on the service. In some cases, those changes will suffice, whereas in other cases, the application that provides the service may need to be configured directly. Finally, some services have no capability to constrain the set of hosts to which they provide a service.</P
><P
>Independent of whether services are disabled or constrained, use host-specific firewalls as a defense-in-depth measure to guard against services being re-enabled and to supplement other constraining mechanisms. Finally, when no other mechanisms are available, host-specific firewalls provide the only means to constrain the computer systems seeking service. This section provided a method for configuring such a firewall.</P
><P
>The house has many doors, windows, and other access points. So does a computer system-through its offered services-and attention must be given to restrict access to only that set of networked computer systems that are allowed to receive service.</P

>Within the domain of a computer system, physical security must also be a concern to the administrator. For example, if you've followed the advice given in this module about ACLs but an intruder can boot a different operating system on your computer-one that disregards the ACLs-then they are useless. ACLs are most relevant when they are interpreted by the operating system for which they are designed.</P
><P
><DIV
CLASS="mediaobject"
><P
><IMG
SRC="../00introduction/images/tech-timeouts.jpg"></P
></DIV
></P
><P
>Consider the following: Imagine that you have a Linux-based system where you have configured the ACLs on various files in a file system. If you remove the disk drive that contains the file system that in turn contains the files whose ACLs you've configure and install that disk drive in another Linux-based system, those ACLs will probably have the same meaning.</P
><P
>Imagine further that the disk is installed in a non-Linux system. Your carefully crafted ACLs probably don't have the same meaning because they are no longer being interpreted by a Linux-based system or by a system that understands the type of file system installed on the disk drive. It is as though there are no ACLs at all.</P
><P
><DIV
CLASS="mediaobject"
><P
><IMG
SRC="../00introduction/images/tech-timeouts-end.jpg"></P
></DIV
></P
><P
>The example above can be generalized to the following: If the fundamental computing paradigm can be changed, then controls used by the system administrator to secure information assets can be rendered meaningless. Earlier we discussed identification and authentication as a principle important to ACLs-if people are improperly identified as users, then the ACLs that discriminate asset access have no meaning. In this module, we consider the physical security of a computing system as a way that an intruder changes this fundamental computing paradigm.</P
><P
>If an intruder seeks to change this paradigm from a physical security perspective, the administrator needs to consider the following:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Interpreting storage information in a different context - This means disk contents are read and acted upon by an operating system that assigns a different meaning to those contents. This can happen in several ways:</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>	- Booting a different operating system on the same hardware - This can happen when the BIOS [BIOSCentral] or EEPROM is improperly secured such that the hardware loads and executes a different operating system. Mitigation strategies include:</P
><P
> -  Passwords - Assigning a BIOS or EEPROM password means that the system cannot be booted differently without that password. Note that some operating systems provide a way to set these passwords from software. Note also that physical access to the motherboard of the computer system may provide a way to clear the BIOS or EEPROM password, therefore rendering those systems vulnerable. You need to know how your system works and where to concentrate your efforts.</P
><P
> -  Changing the boot device order - If you can change the boot order, then change it to reflect from where the operating system should boot. The boot order usually requires the BIOS or EEPROM password.</P
><P
> -  Locking hardware to prevent tampering - Some motherboards contain circuitry that allows the CMOS RAM (which contains BIOS/EEPROM configuration information such as boot order and passwords) to be cleared. An intruder can gain access to that motherboard if the computer's cabinet can be opened. Again, check the specifics of your systems to see what is possible and therefore what mitigation strategies to apply.</P
><P
> -  Removing unneeded devices so that they cannot participate in the boot process - This is a more drastic step that may make routine maintenance on your systems more difficult. One of the challenges of systems administration is balancing the security of a system against its usability. By removing the floppy disk and CDROM from a system, you have eliminated those boot options and have improved the security of the system.</P
><P
> -  At the same time, you have also eliminated them as fallback boot methods that can be useful in the event of a corrupted hard disk, for example. Only the administrator can select the appropriate choice-to remove or not to remove-given the requirements of the system in its production setting.</P
><P
> -  Locating computer systems in a secure facility - By placing a computer system in a secure facility, some physical security concerns can be addressed. Much as your house could be in a private community with gates and fencing designed to keep out traffic, your computer systems could be placed behind layers of locked doors.</P
><P
> -  Removing the hard drive - If the hard drive can be removed from the computer system and installed elsewhere, the paradigm can again be changed. This happens most often with a portable computing system such as a laptop computer. The mitigation strategies of locking the hardware to prevent tampering and locating computing systems in a secure facility also apply here.</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Denying service - This means that the computer system where the information assets are stored is rendered useless through damage or theft. If an intruder's intent is to deprive users of the benefits of accessing an information asset, then destroying it or stealing it achieves that goal. Even if the computer system is locked against tampering with the hardware, it may be possible to steal it or destroy it. Care should be taken so that that cannot happen either.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>In summary, concerns about physical access revolve around changing the paradigm by which information stored on the hard disk is changed by processing that information through a different operating system. The hardware is either made to run another operating system or the hard disk is moved to another computer system where it is processed differently. There are various mitigation strategies available to the administrator. Finally, the computer system itself can be stolen or destroyed, rendering the information unavailable for its intended audience.</P

>The second step in the SKiP Method is named Prepare. One of the essential concepts behind Prepare is that there are vulnerabilities that have not yet been discovered, discovered but not yet fixed, or discovered, fixed, but not yet patched. No matter what the reason, these vulnerabilities were or could not be addressed by the Harden/Secure step. The system administrator, therefore, needs a way to recognize when these vulnerabilities have been or are being exploited.</P
><P
>To support such recognition, the Prepare step uses a technique called anomaly-based intrusion detection. Key to that is learning how the computer system operates when it's operating normally. If the SA knows what normal operation is, it's much easier to spot abnormal or anomalous operation. Such anomalous behavior is most likely the result of an intruder's attacks or break-ins.</P
><P
>Learning how the computer system operates normally is called characterization. This topic describes what and how to characterize a computer system. The same techniques apply to other network devices as well, such as network infrastructure components and SFUs.</P
><P
>Some of the system attributes characterized in the Prepare step make use of robust and mature applications but unfortunately not all of them. This means that to fully support all of the characterization tasks, the SA will need to continue to monitor information sources for new applications or in the mean time, build ad hoc schemes. This section gives some suggestions on applications to use to get started.</P
><P
>Notice from the SKiP Method icon that Prepare is entered from two different places:</P
><P
>From Harden/Secure: In this case, the computer system has not yet been installed in the production environment. It is still in the air-gapped test environment. It does have all of the applications needed to operate it in a production environment. This happens only once.</P
><P
>From Improve: In this case, the computer system has been installed in the production environment. It has been changed in some way by the Respond or Improve steps to be discussed later and it needs to be characterized again because of these changes.</P
><P
>No matter how the computer system entered this step, the next task is to characterize its behavior. To summarize, the idea is simple: if you know how the computer system works normally, it is easier to recognize when is operating abnormally. If you spot abnormal behavior, you then need to look for other signs of attack and intrusion.</P
><P
>In our block of wood analogy, our master crafter prepares his Web server by inspecting it so that he can learn all about it. By X-raying his Web server, he can see the knots in the wood, the depth of the hardware he's selected to attach his Web server to its holder outside of his shop, and all other defects originally in the wood and those introduced by his chiseling. He knows all about his Web server and is now able to recognize any changes that occur over time.</P
><P
>On a computer system, characterization entails examining a system's operation and performance under normal conditions and recording expected behavior as the system's known, baseline state. This baseline state also contains information (also called attributes) about expected changes at the network, system (including kernel), process, user, file, folder/directory, and hardware levels. Once a trusted baseline state is captured, SAs subsequently compare attributes of an executing system to the baseline to learn if something has change. The SA can then make an informed judgment as to whether or not the change is acceptable and expected.</P
><P
>One way to think about the distinction between Harden/Secure and the characterization part in Prepare is that hardening attempts to solve known problems by applying known solutions, whereas characterization helps to identify new problems. In using a characterization baseline for comparison, problems can be identified through anomaly-based detection techniques, that is, departures from normal behavior, so that new solutions can be researched and applied.</P

>For each of the attributes of the system being characterized, namely files and folders/directories, the network, the kernel, processes, and hardware, the characterization task produces data that will ultimately be used in the Detect step in the SKiP Method to determine if the computer system is working normally. The integrity of that characterization data is vital to the process of determining anomalous behavior. How should that characterization data be managed and where should it be stored?</P
><P
>How that data is managed and where it's stored depends on the applications selected to do the characterization and anomalous behavior detection tasks. This is an important issue. If an intruder is able to change characterization data, they can change the definition of normal operation to include their activities. They could then easily defeat anomaly-based intrusion detection if they can change that data. So, it is vital to spend the resources needed to improve the integrity of characterization data.</P

><P
>For example, the AIDE application uses digital signatures to guarantee the integrity of the characterization data and the configuration files used to produce that data. This technique gives some freedom as to where that data is stored. Unfortunately, other characterization applications do not have this digital signature capability built in. You'll have to devise your own scheme for guarding the integrity of the characterization data. Other applications such as OSSEC and Samhain use a client/server architecture. The server stores the signatures and initiates the scans at a given time. This will require strong ACL's and host based hardening of the server storing the signatures.</P
><P
>These days one of the easiest ways to improve the integrity of the characterization data and the configurations that produce it is to create CDROMs that contain it. Use cryptographic checksums and digital signatures like those provided with PGP11 and GPG 12 to help ensure characterization baseline integrity. Both of these techniques help to reduce the likelihood that the characterization data and configuration can be altered by anyone, including an intruder.</P

>Part of the characterization practices seek to identify the types of changes that are made in the file system, that is, what files are routinely changed, added, deleted, and what folders/directories are routinely changed, added, and deleted. The reason to characterize the state of files and folders/directories is that after a break-in you will want to answer the question, What changed? If you know what changed, its easier to repair the system and put it back in to production. And if you can minimize the time that a computer system is unavailable, that system can more easily support the mission of the enterprise.</P
><P
>How do you determine what the files and folders/directories looked like before the break-in, and where were these files located? Chances are you're not really sure. Not only that, it's hard to tell unless you've taken steps to record the kind of information that can help you decide what changed.</P
><P
>To help you keep track of the files and folders/directories on your computer and their content, you need to acquire a free or commercial version of a program called an integrity monitor. An integrity monitor checks files and folders/directories to see what's changed since they were last inspected. These programs use advanced mathematics, such as SHA256 and RIPEMD 160 checksums, to detect even the smallest of changes. You run an integrity monitor during the Prepare step of SKiP and then periodically during the Detect step to see what changed since the last time you checked.</P
><P
>While this sounds easy, unfortunately it's not and therein lays the problem. The challenge is to know what changes to files and folders/directories can be expected as part of the normal operation of a computer system. Unexpected changes are likely to be the result of something else, an intruder's activities for example.</P
><P
>How do you know what changes to expect? The vendors could tell you but they don't, so you'll have to figure that out for yourself. One way to do this is to run the integrity monitor once during the initial Prepare step to determine what files and folders are there and what they contain. After you've created a baseline for your computer, use it for a while and then run the integrity monitor again. The changes you see should be expected. Over time, you'll learn what's okay and what's not. This is a time-consuming and tedious process. But if you want to know what's changed, that's what it takes.</P

><P
>How do you know that the baseline characterization data created in the Prepare step and the characterization data recreated in the Detect step reflect the true state of the system and have not been altered in some way? Who checks the checkers?</P
><P
>All applications installed on a computer system are fair game for an intruder, so relying on them to accurately characterize that computer system presents a risk. To lessen that risk, consider installing those characterization applications on a CDROM that contains the characterization data and related configuration files.</P
><P
>Be advised that most modern operating systems use some type of execution-time linking facility. Therefore the CDROM that contains the characterization applications should be self-referential in that those applications only use other files that are installed on the CDROM. They don't use any files from the computer system's potentially compromised disks.</P
><P
>With this approach, you're only relying on the integrity of the operating system for the characterization effort. Given what was reported in "Bypassing Integrity Checking Systems" (Halflife), it is possible that that operating system could be changed giving misleading results. That's an assumption you'll need to make and a risk you'll have to take.</P

>Once a problem is discovered, our master crafter needs to respond to the problem. In this case, the crafter selected hardware that wasn't up to the task; it wasn't strong enough to hold the Web server, so it crashed to the ground. The crafter needs to repair the wood and then select hardware better suited to the weight of the Web server.</P
><P
>On a computer systems, and again once a problem is discovered, SAs perform several practices to Respond to and contain the problem. The response can be as simple as taking minimal to no action by accepting the risk or taking significant steps to contain and recover from the problem. Successful response means that the system is recovered to a configuration and operational capability that existed before the compromise.</P

><UL
><LI
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>Further analyzes the effects of, the scope of, and damage caused by the intrusion</B
></SPAN
> - The SA needs to understand what happened, the effects on the business, and any collateral effects to appropriately respond to the intrusion. Dealing with the effects of an intrusion may result in the insertion of new technology, practices, procedures, and personnel. Overreacting by unjustifiably introducing security measures may hamper the organization's ability to conduct business, ultimately leading to a loss or the end of that business.</P
></LI

CLASS="bold"

CLASS="emphasis"
>Contains these effects as far as possible</B
></SPAN
> - One of the many challenges SAs faces in responding to an intrusion is deciding when they have learned enough about that intrusion so that they can take the appropriate recovery steps versus continuing to monitor an intruder's actions so as to discover all access paths and entry points. It is a delicate balancing act. If an SA does not discover and eliminate all intruder access paths, then it is likely that the intruder will return. However, if the intruder is allowed to roam through systems, then the damage caused to an organization's assets may be fatal. Identifying and containing the full effects of an intrusion can be a very difficult task and can take an extended period of time.</P

><P
><SPAN
CLASS="bold"

CLASS="emphasis"
>Works to eliminate future intruder access</B
></SPAN
> - Part of the analysis activity involves discovering how the intruder gained access. Frequently, there is a strong push to return a system to operation even if it means recovering to a previous but vulnerable and insecure state. In this event, the compromised system state is lost, as are the indicators of how the intrusion happened. The key is to consciously decide that this is the desired course of action and to recognize the ramifications of that decision.</P
></LI

><P
><SPAN
CLASS="bold"

CLASS="emphasis"
>Returns the system to a known, operational state while continuing to monitor and analyze</B
></SPAN
> - One of the goals of responding to an intrusion is to return the system to a usable state. That state should be an improvement over the previous state that resulted in the intrusion. Once the system is returned to operation, it is a heightened target for intruders, who may be planning to gain access through back doors they have installed. An administrator may learn more about the intruder's attack methods (and therefore the required defenses) through more detailed monitoring and analysis.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>While these activities are going on, an SA notifies all other parties that may be affected, conveying concise, accurate, and appropriately directed reports of the intruder's activities and the response actions taken. This notification must be in concert with the organization's information dissemination policy and it should be in a language and style appropriate to those parties. Principle 10: Communication skill is critical to reach all constituencies applies here.</P
><P
>An administrator must collect and protect information that may become evidence in possible legal proceedings against the intruder, regardless of the organization's policy on prosecuting intruders. An organization must assume that other sites affected by the intrusion will request this information for use in their prosecutions, perhaps by subpoena.</P
><P
>The collection and analysis of intrusion-related information is called computer forensics. It is a growing information security discipline characterized by new applications, practices, and procedures. An administrator should track developments in this area including the availability of new analysis approaches and applications.</P
><P
>If the transition to Respond is the result of some other external stimulus, that stimulus is addressed and then the process transitions to Improve. For example, if the stimulus is the release of a patch from a vendor, the administrator applies the patch that constitutes completion of Respond.</P
><P
>Respond activities take place when the system is operating in a production mode. Systems may be unavailable for a period of time while repairs are made.</P
><P
>An administrator needs a test environment to more fully understand the nature of the intrusion. In this environment, an administrator may be able to run a quarantined version of any captured attack tools to learn which vulnerabilities the intruder has used to gain access, thus ensuring that these means of access have been removed before the systems are returned to operation.</P

This information often serves as the most compelling argument to convince management to allocate sufficient resources to address security issues. At a minimum, capture staff effort (hours, weeks) and capital investments with respect to the following questions:</P

>Publicity - There may have been others in the enterprise not directly involved in the incident and there may have been people outside of the organization who learned about it some way. The publicity and reporting practices and procedures need to be evaluated with respect to the following questions:</P

><P
>- Was there a summary report that described the incident and its various costs and levels of effort?</P

>Improve takes place when the system is operating in a production mode, though we strongly recommend installing and executing any new applications in a test environment before deploying them.</P
