>Functional Units need to provide service to an authenticated constituency in a survivable manner [CERT a]. Recall from Principle 1: Survivability is an enterprise-wide concern that survivability is "the ability of a network computing system to provide essential services in the presence of attacks, failures, or accidents and recover full services in a timely manner." It is critical to architect services to be survivable because of networks increased dependence upon the Internet and the increasing sophistication of attacks. Functional Units, therefore, must be survivable and survivability must become a design criteria.</P
><P
>Unfortunately, applying survivability in an operational setting is not yet well defined. There are few practices that can be used when architecting and building a Survivable Functional Unit. Nonetheless, we can make some improvements to our Web Delivery and Development Functional Unit to make it more survivable. Those improvements may be but are not limited to the following:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>A distributed delivery architecture can be made that uses several computer systems. These computer systems are connected to different networks and each is connected to the Internet through a different Internet service provider (ISP). This redundancy attempts to mitigate the risks of an attack on any one of the computer systems or ISPs.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The Domain Name Service Functional Unit balances the load from the constituency across all of these computer systems through round-robin or some other scheduling approach. This scheme attempts to make the number and placement of the delivery computer systems transparent to the constituency.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The infoprocs are kept up-to-date with respect to patches. Timely patch applications is one of the most significant actions that a system administrator can take to defend against intrusion attempts.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The infoprocs are instrumented for host-based anomaly intrusion detection as described in the next set of lectures on the SKiP Method. This early warning technology helps the system administrator recognize when computer systems are under attack. This is Principle 7: Security Knowledge in Practice (SKiP) provides a structured approach.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The selected authentication scheme is very strong, perhaps using some combination of one-time passwords and biometric identification. This attempts to reduce unauthorized access to a computer system and its services. This is Principle 5: Identification of users, computer systems, and network infrastructure components is critical.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>All network-based administrative activity uses strongly authenticated and encrypted connections. This attempts to reduce the unauthorized access and defends against inadvertent disclosure of the administrative session. This is also Principle 5: Identification of users, computer systems, and network infrastructure components is critical.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Physical survivability issues also need to be considered, such as uninterruptible power supplies and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) requirements. These need not be addressed in detail but need to be mentioned.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>This Functional Unit architecture increases the likelihood that our example Web servers are able to deliver their content to the Internet constituency in the face of attacks and failures. These include attacks affecting one or more of the infoprocs that separate the Web servers from those seeking service.</P
