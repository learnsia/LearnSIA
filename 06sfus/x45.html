>Successful enterprises fulfill their missions for their constituencies. Computer systems and network infrastructure components are playing an increasing role in those successes, to the point where intrusions or even just attacks against them can adversely affect the enterprise's ability to deliver its products and services to its customers. While SAs often needs to focus on the details of those computer systems and network infrastructure components, they must also be able to stand back from that level to see the role that these technologies play in support of the enterprise's missions. In short, they must be careful not to miss the forest for the trees.</P
><P
>It's sometimes difficult for SAs to look at their computer systems and network infrastructure components at a more global level due to the pressures of time and the demands of technology. While short-term, technology-centered achievements are satisfying, they may not support the enterprise's mission. Indeed, they may even be in opposition to that mission. The SA needs a way to balance the demands of technology with the enterprise's need to satisfy critical missions.</P
><P
>This part of "Principles of Survivability and Information Assurance" describes a way to think about an enterprise's networks. It helps SAs more easily see the big picture that shows how their technological charges support the enterprise's missions.</P
><P
>The cornerstone of this thought process is the notion of a Survivable Functional Unit (SFU) which is</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>a collection of one or more computer systems and network infrastructure components (routers, firewalls, hubs, switches, access points, etc)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>that delivers one or more information assets</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>through one or more services</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>to one or more constituencies</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>authenticated to the Survivable Functional Unit in some fashion</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>and that can survive attacks, outages, errors, etc.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>By thinking about the enterprise's network as a collection of SFUs rather than as computers, routers, hubs, switches, firewalls, etc., SAs focus on what these groupings of technology provide in support of the mission of the enterprise. And that's where their focus ought to be-on the mission. An SA's job is to decide how best to support that mission with technology, augmented by practices, policies, and procedures.</P
><P
>The concept of SFUs also helps SAs be more efficient because they have fewer things to think about all the time. By grouping technology into functional areas (SFUs), SAs can often think and work at that functional level. They have fewer items to juggle, helping them to focus on what needs really attention.</P
