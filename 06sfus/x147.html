>A typical enterprise (business, university, or even a home network) has a collection of computer systems and network infrastructure components  that are intended to help the enterprise achieve its mission. In most cases, these computer systems are connected by a network infrastructure made up of routers, firewalls, hubs, switches, wires, wireless access points, and network interface cards (NICs). The way that an enterprise's computer systems are interconnected and the selection of network infrastructure components vary from enterprise to enterprise, sometimes widely. Presently, there are few best practices that guide system administrators through the task of architecting and building these networks.</P
><P
>Each infoproc in the enterprise's network has one or more roles that are achieved by providing a service to a constituency. For example, one infoproc could provide time synchronization information to other infoprocs in the enterprise's network.</P
><P
>Consider a randomly selected enterprise's network. It should be possible to group the infoprocs in this network into higher-level, function-oriented entities that we'll call Functional Units. A Functional Unit is a collection of one or more infoprocs that delivers one or more information assets through one or more services to one or more constituencies authenticated to that Functional Unit in some way, and the way in which infoprocs are grouped together into Functional Units is called the Functional Unit Identification Process. As a system administrator, think at the Functional Unit level rather than at the infoproc level as a way to simplify your job and to better understand how technology supports enterprise missions.</P
><P
>Later in this section, we'll describe the Functional Unit Identification Process and in "Sustaining, Improving, and Building Survivable Functional Units (SFUs)" and you will have the opportunity to apply this process to an enterprise network.</P
